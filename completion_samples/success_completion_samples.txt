<think> I need to combine 84, 92, and 27 using the arithmetic operations to make 35. Let's start examining the possibilities:
1. If we use subtraction, it's clear that subtracting any of these numbers from another will not give us 35 because the numbers are too big.
2. Multiplication or division won't work either since the resulting values are either much larger or not integers.
3. That leaves subtraction and addition, but I can't simply take one number away from another to get the difference equal to 35.
4. One possible strategy is to combine the numbers in a way that some operations result in subtractions and others in additions that eventually give 35.
</think>
Given that no straightforward operations seem to directly yield 35, I can creatively use a combination of addition and subtraction for the numbers.
<answer>(92 + 27 - 84)</answer>
Let's check the equation:
<think>When I perform this equation, let's break it down:
1. Start with 92 and add 27: 92 + 27 = 119
2. From this result, subtract 84: 119 - 84 = 35.
Therefore, the equation (92 + 27 - 84) does indeed yield 35.</think>
The final equation that uses the numbers 84, 92, and 27 with basic arithmetic operations to equal 35 is: <answer>(92 + 27 - 84)</answer>

==============
<think>Since you want to arrive at 82 using the numbers 6, 5, and 81 exactly once each, we need to think about creative ways to add, subtract, multiply, or divide those numbers to hit the target. 

Firstly, multiply 81 by any number to increase the value significantly to get close to 82. If we multiply 81 by 1 (which is 81), it's a good start, and then subtract to hit exactly 82. Multiplying 81 by 1 gives us 81, and 82 - 81 = 1. Thus, we need to make 1 from 5 and 6 with basic operations.</think>
<answer> 81 - 5 + 6 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 71, 78, and 66 to form an equation that equals 59. I should initially think about the operations that might yield this result. Multiplication and division don't seem promising as 71, 78, and 66 don't yield 59 when multiplied or divided in various ways. Adding and subtracting might be viable. The sum of 71 and 66 is 137 and the difference would be -11. Both of these are far from 59. Subtracting 78 from 71 or 66 or 78 from 71 or 66 could potentially yield 59. Let's check these possibilities:</think>
<answer> (71 - 78) + 66 </answer>
<think> If I perform these operations now, I can actually get to the number 59:
71 - 78 = -7, then -7 + 66 = 59
Thus, the equation that equals 59 using the numbers 71, 78, and 66 is:
<answer>(71 - 78) + 66</answer>
</think>

==============
<think> First, I will consider the target number to reach, which is 35. Then, I'll carefully evaluate which combination and order of basic arithmetic operations can yield the result using the given numbers: 90, 85, and 30.
- Let's start by looking at the use of subtraction:
  - 90 - 85 = 5
  - 90 - 30 = 60
  - 85 - 30 = 55
- Now, let's see if any of these results can be combined with the other numbers to get to 35.
- Try 85 - 30 + 5 = 55 + 5 - 85 = -25, which is not 35.
- Now, let's try combining numbers by multiplication and addition: 
  - 90 * (85 - 30) = 90 * 55 = 4950
  - 90 * (85 - 30) is much higher than 35, so this won't work.
  - Let's also consider 90 * (85 + 30) = 90 * 115 = 10350, which also doesn't work.
- At this point, I will try using the subtraction and division:
  - 85 - (30 / 90) = 85 - 0.3333 (which isn't an exact division).
  - This isn't exact either. I should also try with 30 as the divisor.
  - 85 / 90 = 0.9444 and subtracting this from 90 results in 90 - 0.9444 = 89.0556 (which is still not 35).
  - Considering 30 / 90 cannot give a straightforward result, let's direct my attention back to 85 - 30.
- Now, 85 - 30 = 55, and see if that can be manipulated with 90.
- 90 - (85 - 30) = 90 - 55 = 35.
This seems to be a correct path. </think>
<answer> 90 - (85 - 30) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll examine the numbers available: 53, 55, and 96. My goal is to form 94 using basic arithmetic operations and ensuring each number is used only once. Breaking it down, 94 is close to 96, so removing or subtracting some number from 96 must be considered. Let's subtract 55 from 96, but then I would need to subtract 53 to get 94, and I would not have a number left to subtract. Subtracting 53 from 96 gives me 43, which I already have. This combination leads to overuse of numbers. Let me consider addition instead.
</think>
From the above analysis, trying to subtract 53 from 96 would leave me with 43 and 55, which is not using all the numbers efficiently. Perhaps the approach should be to add.
<think> Let's consider adding numbers instead: 53 + 55 - something makes 94. I know 55 + 53 equals 108, but I want 94. It seems adding them gives me over 94. Let's think about 96 - something = something I get to add, ensuring I only use each number once. Since 96 - 53 = 43, I have 55 to use. 55 doesn't add up to 51. Let's experiment with 96 - 55 = 41. This isn't 94 either. Finally, if I subtract 53 from 96, then add the remaining 55, I get 94. </think>
Following the logic, 96 - 53 = 43, and then adding 55 to 43 gives us 98. This is very close but not exactly 94. But if I consider 96 - 55 = 41, and then adding the remaining 53, it equals 94. This uses each number only once and results in 94.
</think>
<answer> 96 - 55 + 53 </answer>

==============
<think>First, I need to find a way to combine the numbers 51, 55, and 71 to make the result 75. Given the possible operations, division and subtraction could be useful. Considering division first since we cannot get a whole number from the other operations:</think>
<think>Dividing 71 by 55 gives 1.2909, which is not helpful. Next, let's consider 71 / 51, which gives 1.3921. That's still not good for our equation. But 55 divided by 51 gives approximately 1.078. So, if we subtract this from 75, we might get one of the other numbers. 75 - 1.078 = 73.922, which isn't a valid option. It seems like division alone isn't working well here.</think>
<think>Let's consider adding and subtracting between the numbers, as one number might become part of a larger sum or difference. Let's try subtracting 51 from 55 then adding back the 71, which would be 55 - 51 + 71:</think>
55 - 51 + 71 = 75
<answer> 55 - 51 + 71 </answer>
</think>

==============
<think> I have the set of numbers 79, 78, and 54. The target result is 53. Let's consider the possible combinations of operations and numbers in order to get to 53. First, I will use the number 54 because it is the closest to the target number. If I use 54 and another number, the difference will be small. I see that 54 - 51 = 3, but I don't have a 51. However, I notice that 79 and 78 can be manipulated to reach 51. I can subtract 78 from 79 to achieve this. Now, 54 - (79 - 78) = 53. </think>
<answer> 54 - (79 - 78) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to arrive at the number 84 using the numbers 37, 7, and 25. Given the numbers, multiplication seems like a logical choice, as we would need a larger number to reach 84. Therefore, I should start by trying to multiply 37 and 7 or 25 to make the number around 84.</think>
Considering 37*7 = 259, which is too large and doesn't seem immediately useful here. Next, let's try to see if we can use 37 and 25 in a different way.
<think> Next, I notice that if I can create a number close to 84 and then use 7, it's more likely that if I add or subtract a bit, I'll end up at 84. Let's see if 37 - 25 first gives a number around 12, since 12 * 7 will give 84, which is what we want.
Let's calculate 37 - 25. </think>
37 - 25 equals 12.
<think> Since 37 - 25 equals 12, and 12 * 7 equals 84, we have found an equation that satisfies the requirement. So the equation becomes (37 - 25) * 7 = 84. </think>
<answer>(37 - 25) * 7</answer>

==============
<think>First, I should try to isolate the number 31 using basic arithmetic operations and the given numbers. With numbers 41, 15, and 87, the equation can be simplified by achieving something close to 31 using these numbers and then adjustment.</think>
1. If we take 87 - 41, we get 46.
2. Then, to get around 31 from 46, we could consider subtraction as it is a straightforward operation. So, 46 - 15 = 31.
3. However, we need to use each number only once, meaning 31 - 15 = 16 doesn't work since we've already used 15 (or should I consider 31 as 46 - 15). 
4. It seems 46 - 15 isn't suited for getting 31, so then we need to explore other combinations - like division and multiplication.
5. If we take 41 / 15, it gives us a decimal around 2.733, which isn't close to our target value.
6. Now, let's check if any of the numbers can be adjusted with either addition or subtraction to get us to 31. For example, if we formed a number close to 31 and then subtracted from 87 or added to 15, this might work.
7. If we take (87 - 41) - 15, we get 46 - 15 = 31, which satisfies our requirement.</think>
<answer>(87 - 41) - 15</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to consider how I can use the numbers 34, 65, 22, and 30 to get to 83 using basic arithmetic operations. Because 34 and 65 are too large on their own to make 83 with a single operation and 30 and 22 are too small, subtraction seems like a good starting point. If I subtract a large number from 65, I might get a manageable number to reach 83 by adding other numbers.</think>
<answer> (65 - 34) + 30 + 22 </answer>
<think> Now let's break down this equation to see if it equals 83.
- Start with 65 - 34 = 31.
- Then adding 30 and 22 to 31: 31 + 30 = 61.
- Finally, 61 + 22 = 83.
Thus, this answer is correct. </think>

==============
<think> I need to combine the numbers 44, 52, and 3 to make 99. Let's start by considering the operations we could perform. We have addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Multiplication could be helpful to increase the value, while division could help us if we end up with a small number. Taking the logarithm might also be considered, but that is beyond basic arithmetic. For now, let's try some straightforward combinations.</think>
- The sum of 44 and 52 is 96, which is close to 99 and leaves us with 3 less than our goal. 
- Now, if we add 3 to 96, we get 99, which is exactly what we want.
Therefore, a possible equation that uses each number exactly once and achieves the target is <answer> 44 + 52 + 3 </answer>. </think>
<answer> 44 + 52 + 3 </answer>

==============
<think> First, consider possible operations that can lead to 24. Multiplication seems promising as it can increase the value quickly. We can start by seeing if the numbers can be broken down into a combination of multiplication which might lead to 24. Given our numbers: 86, 45, and 65, (86 * 45) - 65 should be evaluated. This results in 3870 - 65 = 3805, not equal to 24. Thus, multiplication isn't the way to go. Next, let's try division. If we divide 45 by some number or perhaps rearrange it with others. Dividing 86 by 45 gives a fraction that isn't useful. We need a whole number. </think>
Let's consider a different operation sequence, combining multiplication and division.
<think> Given the numbers 86, 45, and 65, let's try 45 * 65 / 86. First, 45 * 65 = 2925. Then, 2925 / 86 = 34.0588, which is close but not exactly 24. Let's see if we can adjust this slightly by adding or subtracting a value. We could try 45 * 65 - 84 which means 2925 - 84 = 2841, still not 24. Then the closest is 45 * 65 + 6 = 2925 + 6 = 2931, which is far from 24. At this point, the combination of operations and numbers doesn't seem right. </think>
Given the constraints, these operations and combinations don't produce 24. There seems to be an oversight or an incorrect understanding of the possible operations. Let's re-examine: 
<think> Considering the numbers 86, 45, and 65, we can use each number only once. The trick seems to be in placing the operations correctly.  The value 86 can be manipulated to get closer to 24. 65 + 45 = 110. Now to get from 110, subtract 86 to get 24. </think> 
Using these steps:
<answer> 65 + 45 - 86 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's analyze the given numbers and the target number. The numbers are 6, 29, and 96. The target number is 73. 
Given the availability of parentheses, it's useful to try various combinations of operations and numbers.
One might consider using subtraction or division to make the target number. But since 6 and 29 don't seem immediately usable with a single operation, let's think about the inclusion of 96. The number 96 can be manipulated by placing a negative sign or by using it as a divisor.
With 29 and 96, division might not produce a clean target number (since it usually leaves remainders). So, let's consider the subtraction or addition strategy. Let's try making 29 - 6 or 29 + 6 to see if it gets us closer to 73.
We'll calculate: 
1) 29 - 6 = 23
This doesn't help because we are 50 short of 73, and we can't use 6 or 29 anymore.
2) 29 + 6 = 35
This is also 38 short of 73.
Now, let's try using 96. 
Let's see if 96 can help us:
96 + 29 - 6 = 121 - 6 = 115, which is too high.
Exploring further possibilities, we can think about combining operations or rearranging numbers in a more complex way:
(96 + 29)/6 = 125/6 = 20.83, which isn't a round number. This is also invalid.
Since we need a whole number and trying to combine directly didn't work out, let's return to simpler attempts:
I remember we were left with 29 and 6.
(96 - 29) + 6 = 67 + 6 = 73. This combo gives us the exact number 73 we aim for.</think>
<answer>(96 - 29) + 6</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have - 1, 2 and 80. We need to make 80 using these. One interesting idea could be to use division and multiplication, as 80 can be composed of using 80 itself or multiples that can be easily created. Let's see if we can use 2 as 2 times something in a way that leaves us with 80. Since 2 is quite small, it would be better to use multiplication, and think if 80 can be split or expressed in some other meaningful way. </think>
Now, let's reason about the next possibility. Currently, 80 is a product of two factors: 80 * 1. Either 1 or 80 could serve as the multiplier. But since we can't reuse numbers, using 1 doesn't contribute anything significant, so the only viable option appears to be using 80 itself.
<answer> 80 * (2 - 1) </answer> </answer>

==============
<think> First, I should assess the given numbers: 26, 39, and 44. It's clear that 39 is quite close to our target number 57, but not quite there. I'll consider if I can achieve 57 using 26 and 44 in a formula because 39 is larger and somehow less helpful for getting 57. Since multiplication or division of these numbers doesn't provide 57, I'll start with addition and subtraction. </think>
<answer> (39 + 44) - 26 </answer> 
Now, let's break this down: 
- 39 + 44 equals 83
- 83 - 26 equals 57
This equation uses all of the given numbers exactly once and results in 57.

==============
<think> We have three numbers: 71, 88, and 83. We need to create an equation that equals 100 using basic arithmetic operations and where each number is only used once. 
First, let's see if we can get close to 100 using these numbers. Adding 71 and 88 results in 159, quite close to 100, but it goes too high. Given the numbers, the negative impact of subtraction should more than make up for this. 
Considering multiplication and division wouldn't reduce the large numbers much, a good approach could be addition and subtraction. 
Since 88 and 83 are closer to each other, let's see if we can achieve something with 88 and 83 and adjust by adding or subtracting 71. If we do this in such a way, we might nullify the difference between 71 and our sum.
Let's consider 88 + 83 - 71. This yields 100. Here’s the equation:  
</think>
<answer> (88 + 83) - 71 </answer>

==============
<think> Initially I have three numbers: 77, 34, and 1. To reach 42, I should check which combinations of operations and numbers can get us there. Given the numbers, I should consider the possibility of performing operations on the three numbers in various ways.
If I add the first two numbers, I get 77 + 34 = 111. Then if I subtract the third number, 111 - 1 = 110. This is too high, so I need to subtract something from this result. Subtracting lower numbers from 110 won't get me to 42.
Instead, I'll consider potential multiplications or divisions. Multiplying 77 and 34 seems impossible as 77*34 = 2618 which is far too high. Dividing 110 or any combination of these numbers 110/77, 110/34, 110/1 are also not feasible.
Looking at which operations and numbers could add up directly, the number 1 does not appear to be useful as a standalone addition or subtraction. Multiplying 34 by 1 won't change the value, so I need to think about a way to combine it with 77 or 1.
Let's try the inverse of the first addition, which is subtraction. So 77 - 34 = 43. Now if we subtract the value 1 from this, we get 43 - 1 = 42. This looks promising!
</think>
<answer> (77 - 34) - 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I should evaluate the numbers and see if simple arithmetic can give me 79. I see that 79 is close to 77, so using 77 directly or in some way seems feasible. The numbers 20 and 22 are far from 79, so combining them seems unlikely without multiplication or division. The division or multiplication of 22 and 20 might give me a higher or lower value than 79, which won't work. Let's start with 77, then use the other numbers. </think>
Now, given the number 77, the only way to combine it with 20 and 22 to get 79 could be through addition or multiplication involving 20. But 20 + 77 already gives us 97, which is way too high, and 20 * 77 gives us 1540, which is also far off.
<think> Knowing this, let me reconsider division or calculation with subtraction. If I include 22, I might need to subtract something to reach 77; otherwise, I would need to add 22 to 77, which doesn't give 79. Since 20 and 22 need to be involved, and given 79, 20 * 22 would give me 440, which is also far. Let's try reversing the addition and subtraction.
</think>
Considering the subtraction approach, if I take 20 and 22 from 77, I get:
<think> 20 - 22 = -2, so subtracting 2 won't work. However, I should still explore:
77 - 20 = 57, which is close to 79.
Using the remaining 22, I could try multiplication to get closer:
57 + 22 = 79. </think>
Therefore, the equation is:
<answer> 77 - 20 + 22 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to work with the numbers 32, 72, and 57 to create an equation that equals 17, using each number only once. I should start by considering possible operations and combinations of the numbers.
First, let's try different operations between pairs or all three numbers.
I'll start by checking multiplication, division, and addition/subtraction combinations to see if any yield 17, including ways to use parentheses for different orders of operations.
Multiplying combinations of 32, 72, and 57 doesn't seem to give 17:
- 32 * 72 = 2304
- 32 * 57 = 1824
- 72 * 57 = 4104

None of these are 17, so division or subtraction/multiplication might be involved. Let's check subtraction or addition in combinations.

Subtracting the numbers:
- 72 - 32 - 57 = -17
- 32 - 72 - 57 = -97
- 72 - 57 - 32 = -17
- 57 - 32 - 72 = -57

That gives us -17, but not 17. Now, let's try addition or a combination of subtraction.

Adding combinations:
- 32 + 72 + 57 = 161
- 32 + 72 - 57 = 47
- 32 - 72 + 57 = 17

Here, 32 - 72 + 57 gives us 17, and all numbers are used exactly once. Thus, this appears to be the solution.

Now, let's box the final equation.
</think>
<answer> 32 - 72 + 57 </answer>

==============
<think> I start with the numbers and what I need to achieve: 54 using basic arithmetic operations with 97, 64, and 87 without repeating any number.
First, I notice that performing division on 87 would likely get me closer to 54, especially as it's the largest number.
87 / 1. 8 = 48. 75 is close but not exactly 54. 
Since we cannot use any number more than once, I thought of using other operations.
Considering the remaining numbers are smaller, there's no simple operation to get close by manipulating them directly. 
The numbers don't lend themselves to straightforward addition, subtraction, multiplication to reach 54.
Then, I think of a possibility where I could do some form of addition or subtraction to tweak the result. 
Let's try manipulating 64 and 97.
64 * 0. 9 = 57. 6
This isn't exact either, but it shows a possibility with decimal places - perhaps using floating point numbers or fractional division.
Then I consider a more direct approach not using division.
87 - 97 + 64 = 54
This fits the numbers exactly, but I have to use all three numbers:
Answer: 87 - 97 + 64 </think>
<answer> 87 - 97 + 64 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I should consider that I need to get 54 by manipulating the numbers 97, 64, and 87. Given that 97 is the largest number, it might need to be subtracted from other numbers to get close to 54. Let's see if I can factor in 64 or 87 to reach that goal.
Since 97 - 64 = 33, and 33 - 18 = 15, and 15 - 10 = 5, we need to achieve 49 by adding numbers in a way that each number only appears once. Notice that if we add these numbers: 87 + 64 - 97 = 54, we can achieve the desired result. </think>
<answer>87 + 64 - 97</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the operation that can quickly get the number 87. Given the numbers 1, 54, and 34, I notice that multiplication could be a strong contender as it can quickly bring these numbers closer to our target number. If I multiply 54 by 1, it just returns 54. However, to approach 87, I'll try to use division with one of these numbers.
   Next, I'll consider division. I can see that 87 can be decomposed into 87 = 54 + 33. The number 33 is close to 34, so I will use 34 for division. 34 divided by something equals 3. 54 divided by 16 gives us 3.375, which is not correct. Let's try 34 divided by 3, which would give 11.333, also incorrect. Next, let's try 34 divided by 3.5, which gives 9.714. Let's try 34 divided by 2.5, which gives 13.6, still not close enough. Trying 34 divided by 4 gives 8.5, and 34 divided by 3.5 gives approximately 9.714, but 34 divided by 3 equals exactly 11.333. This seems to be the best approach as 54 divided by 3 = 18, which if added to 34 divided by 3 equals 21 + 8.714 = 29.714. Not quite 87. Let's try another perspective.
   Now let's see if using the subtraction and addition operations might lead us to 87 faster. If I take 54 - 1 = 53, and then try to get to 87 with the remaining 34, 34 + 53 is 87. This gives the equation 54 - 1 + 34 = 87.
   This seems logical and avoids needing complex multiplications. 
   Let's denote this final equation. </think>
<answer> 54 - 1 + 34 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation equal to 44 using the numbers 27, 92, and 21, one effective approach is to first look at the difference between 92 and 27 and then manipulate this difference with other numbers to make 44.
The difference between 92 and 27 is 65.
If we can make 65 from the number 21, then we would be able to use the required numbers to achieve our goal. This means we need to subtract 21 from 65, which gives us 44.
\[ 65 = 92 - 27 \]
So,
\[ 44 = 65 - 21 = (92 - 27) - 21 \]
Therefore, the equation we are looking for can be made as:
\[ 92 - 27 - 21 = 44 \]
</think>
<answer> 92 - 27 - 21 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the operations and how I can manipulate the numbers to reach 44. Since we can use each number only once, I'll try to do small calculations involving two of the numbers first, and then use the result with the remaining number to see if it equals 44.
The numbers given are 27, 92, and 21. 
From 27, 92, and 21:
- 92 - 27 = 65. This is not close to 44.
- I'll consider combinations using 27 and 21 together.
- 27 + 21 = 48. Again not 44.
- Now I'll examine 92 - 27 - 21: This would give me 44. But 44 is not 92 - 27 - 21.
Let's try another approach: using different combinations or operations.
Now I'll try combining them in the form of: (a * b) - c. I'll start with 92 as it seems like it can take on a larger role. I'll test 92 with 27, but I remember that 92 - 27 = 65. This is too high, so I'll discard that. Now, let's try 92 / 27. This doesn't yield a whole number either.
92 / 27 is approximately 3.37, which is not close to what we need. Let's reconsider the use of subtraction.
92 - 27 - 21 also doesn't give us 44 because 92 - 27 - 21 = 44, but we need 44 to be the result.
(27 + 21) - 92 is negative, so 44 is not the result.
I notice now that if I consider 21 as a base operation and combine it with remaining digits:
(92 / 21) + 27 = 4.4285 + 27 = 31.4285, which is also not 44.
It seems I need to reconsider the full number equation usage considering multiplication and addition might be better.
Let's have a look at possible combinations using * and +:
Taking 27 * 1 = 27.
Then, 92 + 27 - 21 = 98 - 21 = 77, not 44.
92 + 21 - 27 = 113 - 27 = 86, not 44.
21 + 27 - 92 = 48 - 92 = -44, which is not 44.
My previous analysis was distilled but now considering subtraction first is best:
Using 92 - 27 - 21 = 44.
Therefore, the final equation that uses all '27, 92, 21' numbers once to get 44 should be:
<answer> 92 - 27 - 21 </answer>. </think>

==============
<think>First, I'll consider the numbers [59, 2, 22] and the target of 48. 59 is clearly too large to reduce to 48 using standard arithmetic operations involving only 2 and 22. So my strategy will be to use 2 and 22 in a way that they can be combined to get close to 48 without exceeding it with the addition or subtraction of 59.
Multiplying 22 and 2 gives 44, which is close to 48 but not quite there. Adding or subtracting 59 from 44 would overshoot 48. Instead, I'll consider division or subtraction.
Considering 22 divided by 2 gives 11, now we need 37 less than 48. I can use 59 in a way that subtracts something to get 37, but this number is too large as dividing any of the numbers by the other doesn't yield a smaller number.
Instead, I'll consider 59 divided by 22, which is approximately 2.68. This is not useful for reaching 48. So, my best shot involves subtracting 22 once, but we need to get closer.
Subtracting 22 from 48 leaves 26, and then the only way to combine 59 and 2 to get close is if 22/2 = 11, and if 59 - 11 = 48.</think>
<answer>59 - 22 / 2 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll examine the numbers we have: 82, 93, and 49. Given we need to create an expression equaling 60, division might be useful, as it can help reduce large numbers. We can notice that 93 has a close relationship to 90, which is an easier target for subtraction from 82 or addition to 49 to reach 60. Let's start considering division and subtraction.
- If I divide 93 by 1. 5 (which is equivalent to 3/2), I would get 62, which is one less than 63, which is pretty close to 60. To reach 60, I need to subtract 2. 
- 82 - 2 = 80, which is not close to 49, but dividing 82 by 4 (since 4 * 20 = 80 and 80 - 2 = 78) would also take us far from the target.
- Another way to consider is to use 93 - 33 = 60, and then see if one of the numbers can be manipulated to equal 33: 93 - 82 = 11, so I have 11 and something to equal 22. 49 + 22 = 71, and then 93 - 71 = 22. We have 93 - 82 = 11, and 49 + 11 = 60.
</think>
<answer> (93 - 82) + 49 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to consider the numbers 71, 63, and 72 and the arithmetic operators we can use. Since we need the result to be 80 and we can use each number only once, we should start with how we can get close to 80. Each number seems a bit low individually, so let's look at various combinations.

Using the numbers as they are doesn't seem promising, so let's try some possible combinations. One avenue to explore is multiplication since large numbers multiplied by smaller numbers can easily bring the value close to 80. 

Multiplying 72 and 1. 111111 (which is 80/72) might help get us close. Unfortunately, we cannot divide 72 by 71 to get a fraction that fits. A practical approach might be to explore simpler fractions and if we can adjust one number to fit the equation using a standard fraction, that could be useful.

Trying 72 * (71/71) = 72 * 1 = 72, which is too high. Trying 72 * (63/71) = 72 * 0. 8861 = 63, which is too low. 

Our next step is to find a way where addition or subtraction or division could help us reach the target of 80. If we could use a conversion or adjust the numbers, it would be helpful. 

For instance, let's consider 72 - 63 + 71 = 80. This seems promising as it uses all numbers once and follows basic arithmetic operations. Now, let's confirm the calculation: 72 - 63 equals 9, and then adding 71 to 9 gives us 80.
</think>
<answer> 72 - 63 + 71 </answer>

==============
<think> To reach 86 using the numbers 11, 20, 76, and 1, let's consider the equation structure. The main approach seems to be an equation involving multiplication or addition to reach the target. Since 76 is a large number, it might be best to use subtraction or division involving it. The number 20 could be helpful as a multiplier or as part of a subtraction. Finally, the number 1 can be useful in small adjustments or to balance the equation.
Let's see if we can manipulate these numbers in any way. If we subtract 11 from 76, we reach 65. If we then add 20 to get 85, we're only 1 short of the target 86. Adding 1 to 85 gives us the desired result.
So the equation should be: 76 - 11 + 20 + 1 = 86
</think>
<answer> 76 - 11 + 20 + 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider what combination of numbers can be manipulated to end up with 62. Since dividing 62 by any of the given numbers would not give us a clean integer, I can only think about adding or subtracting. Also, given that 62 is close to 61, it's helpful to think about how to use 70 or 71 in a way that might cancel out a number very close to it, resulting in 62.
Because 70 - 61 = 9 and 62 - 9 = 53 (which isn't directly helpful), I'll consider subtracting 61 from 71 or 70 from 61. The former would give me 11, and if I could somehow subtract 11 to get 62, that might work. 62 - 11 = 51, which isn't 62, but I think if I can multiply or divide in a clever way, that final subtraction might work.
Given 70 is 1 less than 71, I can think about adding 1 to one of the numbers to reach 62. Multiplying by 7 (since 7 * 8 = 56, close to 62) might be useful. So, let's try:
62 * 1 = 62 (using 1 implicitly from 70 or 71).
70 + 1 = 71.
71 - 1 = 70, which doesn't help.
Or, I can think of using the inverse operations.
If I take 70 - 61 = 9 and then try to get to 62 from this 9, I need to add 13. 71 - 9 = 62.
So, the key equation steps will be:
62 = 71 - (70 - 61). This removes 9 from 71 and then adds the 13 to get 62.
</think>
<answer> 71 - (70 - 61) </answer>

==============
<think> Given the numbers [35, 76, 42], we need to create an equation that equals 69 using only these numbers once. Let's explore the possibilities:
1. First, I'll consider combinations of addition and subtraction.
2. Second, multiplication and division can also be explored.
Looking at 76 and 42, if we subtract 42 from 76, we get 34. This is close to 69. Now if we can use 35, it can help bridge the gap.
(76 - 42) + 35 = 69
Now let's verify: 76 minus 42 equals 34, and then adding 35 gives us 69.
</think>
<answer>(76 - 42) + 35</answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 15, 25, and 76 once, and we have arithmetic operations to use. To get the result 36, we can start trying some combinations that might work. The number 76 seems too large to significantly reduce the sum, so we turn our attention to 15 and 25.
One possible approach is to reduce 76 in some way that results in a value close to 36. We can do this by division. Dividing 76 by 2 or 3 won't give us an integer, so we consider division by 2.5 to keep things simpler. However, since 76 is not divisible by 2. 5 exactly, let's try using 25. We need 76 minus a certain number to be 36, and 25 fits this perfectly. Hence, 76 - 25 = 51. Now we have 15 and 51. We need to reach 36 using these. If we simplify 51 by subtracting 15, we get 36, since 51 - 15 = 36.
</think>
<answer> 76 - 25 - 15 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to consider the numbers 14, 20, and 8 and explore how they could be combined to equal 48. We could try using multiplication and addition or subtraction.
Seeing that 20 and 8 could potentially be multiplied together to give a higher number that would be easier to work with, I will start there. I can calculate that 20 * 8 = 160. Now I have 14 left and an excess of 160, which is far from 48. 
Next, let's try multiplication and subtraction. If I use 14 * 8, I get 112, still much higher than our goal of 48. If I try 20 - 14, I get 6. But 6 * 8 is way too high and doesn't help us get closer to 48.
Now I think about how I can use subtraction with these numbers. If I use 20 - 14, I get 6, and then multiply that by 8, I get 48, as 6 * 8 = 48. This seems to be a feasible strategy.</think>
<answer> (20 - 14) * 8 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to generate an equation using the numbers 34, 9, and 73 that equals 48. It seems the division operation might be crucial as using multiplication or addition with these numbers won't reach the target number. I will try different combinations involving these numbers in a way that leads to 48.
- Start by considering division. If I divide 73 by a number, let's test 73/9, that gives a value around 8.11, which is close but not enough. Now let's test dividing 73 by 3, which gives 24.33, still not 48.
- Next, consider the possibility of subtracting from 34 to get to 48. Let's subtract 34 from 73 and then work with the difference. 73 - 34 = 39. Now, to reach 48, we need an additional 9. The number 9 is already given and is sufficient. Thus, 39 + 9 = 48.
This way, the equation becomes 73 - 34 + 9 = 48.
</think>
<answer>73 - 34 + 9</answer>

==============
<think> 
First, we need to reach 85 using the numbers 5, 3, and 20. We start by considering how multiplication can help us reach or get close to 85 as we can use 20 for this. 

20 x 4.25 = 85, but we need 4.25 and 4.25 is not an integer or a number we are provided. We have 5 and 3, so looking for a combination involving these might work.

Considering division, let's check if we can form 4.25 using 5 and 3. Dividing 20 by 5 gives 4, and dividing 20 by 3 gives approximately 6.67. Although not exactly 4.25, we can calculate the part 4.25 by adding the result of dividing 20 by 3 and some fraction from 20. The fraction aspect might come from extra 5 or 3, but unfortunately, 3/3 = 1 and 5/5 = 1, they are not part of 4.25. However, dividing 20 by 3 gives 6.67 which is just above 4.25.

Another approach is to consider a combination using multiplication and subtraction. 
5 x 17 = 85 and 17 = 20 - 3.
Hence, the equation can be constructed as:
5 * (20 - 3) = 85.
</think>
<answer> 5 * (20 - 3) </answer>

==============
<think> Starting with the numbers [3, 70, 3], we need to create an equation that equals 76. I'll start by considering the larger number, 70, as it would be beneficial to make use of it in any equation. One way to manipulate the numbers could be to use basic arithmetic.
Firstly, let's try to combine the smaller numbers in some way to add to 70. Since 70 is a large number, one of the numbers 3 could be replicated, meaning we could use both numbers 3 in some arithmetic.
Considering an operation that can incrementally add numbers together, I think multiplication is a good fit because we need to have an intermediate number that can then be manipulated further. This brings our equation to (3 * 3) + 70, but this will give us 79, which is more than 76.
Instead of multiplication, we can consider addition or subtraction now. If we called the 3 as x, we'll see how adding 70 and 3 can be manipulated.
Adding the 3 and 70 gives us 73, which is still not 76. If we subtract the 3 from 73, we get 70, and now we only need to add 6 to reach 76. 
Now, 6 can be formed by using the 3 and 3 (3 + 3 = 6). So, we know we can take 3, 3 and 70 to create 76.
Hence, our equation would be 70 - 3 + 3. Let's check the calculation: 70 - 3 = 67, and then 67 + 3 = 70, which isn't exactly 76. It seems I've overlooked the 3 in the beginning that I can use once again.
Using the 3 from 70 and calculating the equation properly, we get (70 - 3) + 3 = 67 + 3 = 70, which is still no 76. 
If I recall there's another possibility to use addition: 70 + (3 +3) = 70 + 6 = 76.
</think>
<answer> 70 + (3 + 3) </answer>

==============
<think> I start with the numbers given: 21, 9, and 88. I need to create an equation using these numbers, and the basic arithmetic operations, such that the equation equals 100. 
First, clearly 88 + 9 + 21 appears to go far beyond 100, so I'll consider operations that yield smaller sums, and possibly using division to reach the total.
Next, I'll check possible combinations using addition, subtraction, and multiplication to get close to 100. 
An equation like 88 + 21 - 9 needs to be checked - this gives a total of 100, which is exactly what we want.
</think>
<answer>88 + 21 - 9</answer>

==============
<think> To reach a total of 59 using the numbers 34, 32, and 57 exactly once, I need to test out different combinations of operations.
One approach could be to see how these numbers relate to 59. Observing that 34 + 25 would give us 59, but 25 isn't one of our numbers.
From 59 - 34 = 25, I recognize that 32 + 57 equals 89, but that exceeds our target and is not useful.
Another useful observation is 57 - 32 = 25, but this still lacks the 25 needed to reach 59.
Adding 34 to 25 is close but we already used all the numbers.
Considering the middle number, 32, as a potential stepping stone could be useful.
Since 32 * 2 equals 64, let's check if we can create 2 again.
34 - 32 = 2, so bringing these numbers together to complete our operation.
Finally, my equation would be:
34 - 32 + 57 = 59.
</think>
<answer> 34 - 32 + 57 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to combine 94, 44, and 27 using basic arithmetic operations to get 77. I should start by considering the highest and lowest values to generate the desired number. One way to approach this is to see if I can use subtraction or division that results in -7, -13, or a positive number close to them, since these can be used in combination with the other numbers. The most significant number here is 94. Let's consider what we need to do with the other two numbers, 44 and 27. 

- First, let's try subtracting the other two numbers from 94. 94 - 44 - 27 = 23. We're halfway there, but not quite at 77. 
- Next, 77 - 23 = 54. 
- Now, I need to work with 44 and 27 remaining to get to 54. 

Notice that if I divide 44 by 27, I get approximately 1.63, and if I take 27*1. 63 which is approximately 44, then I need to subtract 27 to get 17. Adding this result to 23 gets me 37, which is far from 54.

However, let's try another approach. What if I subtract 44 from 94 to get 50, and then add 27 to that result to ultimately get 77? This would mean 94 - 44 + 27 = 77, yielding the result we want.

This seems to be the correct solution. Now, I'll format it accordingly. </think>
<answer> (94 - 44) + 27 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to combine the numbers 20 and 72 in a way that gives me a number close to 89. Adding them is logical, so I get 20 + 72 = 92. Now I have to reduce this to 89; I can subtract 3 from 92 to get 89. Thus, the equation is 20 + 72 - 3 = 89.
</think>
<answer>20 + 72 - 3</answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to look at the required number which is 89. We have three numbers to play with: 20, 72, and 3. Let's try to manipulate these numbers using basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).
One possible strategy is to use subtraction and addition as both operations can work with all three numbers. 
If we consider subtracting 3 from 72 and then adding 20 to the result, we get:
72 - 3 + 20
Now we can calculate this:
72 - 3 = 69
69 + 20 = 89
This should give us the required sum of 89.
</think>
<answer> (72 - 3) + 20 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I will consider how the numbers 19, 53, and 58 can be combined to get 92 using basic arithmetic operations. Looking at each number, 58 seems to be the most intuitive to use as it's close to 92. One possible approach is to subtract 53 from 58 and then add 19. So, let's calculate this: (58 - 53) + 19.
Now, let's check if the equation equals 92:
(58 - 53) + 19 = 5 + 19 = 24
It seems this is not the correct equation. Let's try another combination:
Another possible approach could be (58 + 19) - 53.
Let's calculate this: (58 + 19) - 53 = 77 - 53 = 24.
Again, this equation is not correct. Given that the equations I've tried so far don't result in 92, let's consider if I'm missing a simpler operation that involves more than one number:
Using the numbers as they are, 92 seems impossible to achieve just with simple arithmetic without slight modifications. However, considering the values 58 and 34 (which can be derived as 58 - 24) might provide a clue. If we could find a way to make 34 out of 53 and 19, it could lead us closer. 
Now, let's consider 53 - 19 = 34.
Then we could build our solution as (58 + 34) / 2 = 92.
Calculating that: (58 + 34) / 2 = 92 / 2 = 46. Here, this doesn't fit the need.
Now, after reconsidering the options keeping each number only usable once, another possible solution could be: (58 - 19) + (53 / 58).
Let's calculate that: (58 - 19) + (53 / 58) = 39 + 0.909 = 39.909. This is close but not exact.
Now, the only possible solution considering the numbers provided and the simple arithmetic operations is using the numbers as is, (58 - 19) + 53.
Let's check this: (58 - 19) + 53 = 39 + 53 = 92.
So, the correct approach seems to be: (58 - 19) + 53 equals 92.
</think>
<answer>(58 - 19) + 53</answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 93, 7, and 2 exactly once to get 84. I will try to manipulate these numbers with basic arithmetic to achieve this result. One way to approach this could involve multiplication to bring down the value of 93 to a more manageable range, or to use the 7 and 2 combination in a way that compliments 93. 
Starting with 93 and 7, let's see how we can utilize these two numbers:
93 - 7 = 86
Now, we want to reach 84. Subtracting any number from 86 could give us 84 but we cannot use 7 again. We can try 86 - 2 = 84. 
Therefore, we have our solution:
93 - 7 - 2 = 84
</think>
<answer> 93 - 7 - 2 </answer>

==============
<think> For the numbers [82, 58, 40], I need to use basic arithmetic operations to reach 64. Let's start by examining how these numbers can be manipulated. I notice that 82 seems very large and 40 seems small. One way to approach this is to try subtracting some number from 82 and then adding another number in a way that gives us 64.
82 - 40 = 42
Now we need to get from 42 to 64. We can see that 42 + 22 = 64.
Since 22 is not one of our given numbers, we can break 22 down using the remaining numbers:
58 - 38 is 20, but our only remaining convenient number is 40.
So 58 - 40 can give us 18. Hence, we can use 40 + 18 to reach our target:
40 + (58 - 40) = 40 + 18 = 58
But we need 22, not 18, so we need to tweak our equation slightly.
By breaking down 64 into 40 + 24, and solving for 24 using the process:
From earlier, we used 58 - 40 = 18.
Adding 22 to 18 equals 40, but we need 24 not 40.
So we need to rework it slightly. We already have 18 from 58 - 40, and if we add the difference between 24 and 18 (which is 6), we get 24:
18 + 6 = 24, making 40 + 24 = 64.
However, we have not yet used the number 82 in our equation. We can think about how 82 might contribute. Notice that any operations we perform on the smaller numbers, we need to ensure they do not make the sum go over 64.
Thus, the combination for 82 that works in the larger equation:
82 - 58 = 24
Now, 40 + 24 = 64.
So now, putting it all together in an equation:
82 - 58 + 40 = 64.
</think>
<answer>82 - 58 + 40</answer>

==============
<think> First, I notice the target number we need to reach is 45. 
Looking at the given numbers 40, 59, and 54, the easiest way might be using subtraction or addition to get close to 45.
Considering 59 is already quite close to 45, I should try to use the other numbers to make up the difference.
Checking out the other options:
- Subtracting 54 from 59 gives me 59 - 54 = 5. 
- Adding 40 to this 5 gives 5 + 40 = 45.
Hence, I can use these numbers and operations to achieve 45.
</think>
<answer>59 - 54 + 40</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 76, 61, and 2. Our goal is to create an equation that equals 17 using these numbers once each and with basic arithmetic operations.
Starting with the total we want to achieve - 17, we notice that it's a relatively small number. Using the whole number 2 as a starting point, we can examine how we can combine 76 and 61 to get close to 17.
If we calculate 76 - 61, we get 15. This is very close to 17, so we're close to our target. To get exactly 17, we need to decrement the value by 2. The number 2 is itself available, so we should use it to make the calculation.
Therefore, the equation can be formed as 76 - 61 + 2 = 17.
</think>
<answer> (76 - 61) + 2 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 53, 70, and 74 exactly once to create an equation that equals 91. First, let's consider the possible combinations of these numbers using basic arithmetic operations.
1. I notice that subtracting 53 from 74 gives me 21.
2. Adding 21 to 70 gives me 91.
3. Therefore, the equation I need is 70 + (74 - 53) = 91.
Now I have a clear equation.
</think>
<answer> 70 + (74 - 53) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 75, 9, and 47. We need an equation that results in 19 using each number exactly once.
Considering division might be useful to reduce the numbers closer to 19, let's divide 75 by 47 to get a result around 1.6, which is close.
75 / 47 ≈ 1.604
If we subtract 9 from this result, we get:
1.604 - 9 = -7.396
This value is far from 19, however, so let's consider other operations. 
Considering 9 is a smaller number, we can use multiplication. Let's try to multiply 9 by a number derived from 47 for something more usable.
75 / 47 * 9 = 14.408
This is closer to 19 but still not exact. 
We notice that subtracting or adding small numbers to 14.408 to get 19 might work. But, since we can only use basic arithmetic and we cannot use 75 and 47 as a whole, let's think more about the structure.
Given 75 - 47 = 28, we can try to incorporate 9 in the equation to get closer. If we take 28 from 19, that leaves 9 * 1 = 9, therefore 75 - 28 = 47 - 9 exactly. 
Hence, (75 - 47) = 9.
So our equation will work like this:
75 - 47 = 28
28 - 9 = 19
So, the only way to write this using the numbers and restricted operations is: 75 - 47 - 9.
</think>
<answer> 75 - 47 - 9 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a combination using these numbers that will equal 22. Let's try to use the largest number first and see if subtracting or adding smaller numbers to it will reach 22.
I notice that 36 - 17 gives me 19. Just a bit less than 22. Now, the difference between 22 and 19 is 3. 
Expanding on this, 10 - 7 = 3.
So, I have 36 - 17 + (10 - 7) which equals 22.
This checks out. 36 - 17 is 19, and 10 - 7 is 3. Adding these gives us 22.
</think>
<answer> (36 - 17) + (10 - 7) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to find a way to use the numbers 1, 26, and 50 in an equation that equals 23. 
Considering the use of basic arithmetic operations and keeping each number only once, I will try to leverage addition and subtraction.
First, let's see how far we can get using 26 and 50. If I subtract 26 from 50, I get 24. 
From 24, if I subtract 1, I get 23, exactly what we need.
The equation would be: 50 - 26 - 1 = 23.
</think>
<answer> 50 - 26 - 1 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers [86, 46, 9], along with basic arithmetic operations, to reach the number 49. Considering we can use each number only once, I'll start by looking for simple operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) that can get me close to 49:
- Multiplication or division of 86 by any of 46 or 9 does not give 49. So I will ignore those operations, because we can't obtain 49 using these ranges.
- Now, let's try to use 86 in an equation with 46 and 9 to hit 49.
- 86 - 9 = 77, which is far from 49.
- 86 - 46 = 40, which is still close but not exactly 49.
- 86 - 46 doesn't work because 46 is too far lower than 86 to be subtracted into the number of 49. 
- Now, let's consider addition: 86 + 46 = 132, while 132 - 83 isn't 49 either. 
- What if we look for making a difference? If we do 86 - (difference of 46 and 9), it could give us closer to the target:
  86 - (46 - 9)
  Let's calculate that:
  first, we calculate 46 - 9 = 37, and then 86 - 37 = 49. This doesn't quite fit the constraint of using each number only once, so let's consider another possibility.
- What if I rearrange my numbers? If I take 9 + 46 = 55, then 86 - 55 = 31. It's close but not 49.
  Next, let's take another approach: using the same 9 and 46 on 86 in a different way:
  9 + (86 / 46) should work. Now let’s calculate more precisely:
  86 divided by 46 equals about 1.8869. Adding 9 to this value doesn't lead to exactly 49.
  I'm missing a different combination: what if we rearrange to 86 - 46 + 9? That equals: 86 - 46 = 40, then 40 + 9 = 49.
</think>
<answer>86 - 46 + 9</answer>

==============
<think> First, I should consider if multiplication and division can contribute to reaching 79 with these numbers. Multiplying any number by 79 would give us a significantly large result, which would require 46*10*43, which is clearly not 79. So, that approach seems unlikely.
Next, let's consider addition and subtraction. If I sum two of these numbers, I need a third number to add to this sum to reach 79. The sum of 46 and 10 is 56. Adding any of the remaining numbers to 56 puts us closer to 79. However, 56+43 equals 99, which is too much.
Considering subtraction, I can subtract a number from a larger number, but subtracting 43 from 10 doesn't make sense as it would be a negative number, and subtracting 10 from 46 would give me 36, which leaves me 43 to add to 36 to reach 79, yet that would exceed 79 without numbers. 
I should try combining numbers in different ways using addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Since I've tried the basic operations and kept 46 and 10 invariant, I should now try multiplying a number with one of the remaining numbers. 10 * 43 gives me 430, which is too large. So, the other strategy remains correct.
Instead, I notice that 46 - 10 = 36. Now I need 43 to reach 79. 79 - 36 = 43 is correct, which means I need to use the operation of subtraction between 46 - 10. 
Therefore, the equation that equals 79 is (46 - 10) + 43. 
</think>
<answer>(46 - 10) + 43</answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 95 using the numbers 43, 71, and 67. Let's start by checking if any two of these numbers can add up to get close to 95.
43 + 71 = 114
114 is too high, so let's try subtraction.
We can also check the other combinations:
71 - 43 = 28
67 - 43 = 24
None of these seemed to work. Now, let's check multiplication and division.
43 * 71 = 3053
67 * 71 = 4757
These are also too high.
However, let's consider squaring or using the reciprocal:
67 squared = 4489
This is too high as well.
Now let's explore the multiplication a bit more closely:
(71 * 67) / 43
Let's calculate that:
71 * 67 = 4757
4757 / 43 = 109
This is not 95.
Finally, let's check if there is a different combination using the numbers. We can do:
71 - (43 / 67)
First, calculate the division:
43 / 67 = 0.6425959039273773
Then, subtract:
71 - 0.6425959039273773 = 70.35740409607263
This is still not equal to 95.
I realize I might have missed something. Let's try a simpler approach and see if combining the numbers in a different way might work:
71 - 43 = 28
And then:
28 + 67 = 95
This works because 28 and 67 are consecutive numbers and add up to get the target number. This means:
71 - 43 + 67 = 95
</think>
<answer> 71 - 43 + 67 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 59, 57, and 33. We need to create an equation that equals 35 using these numbers only once and with standard operations. 
The number 35 is close to 33, but also close to 59 and 57. It seems 35 can be an approach of subtracting or adding the difference.
35 = 59 - 24
Now let's see if we can express 24 using the given numbers:
24 = 57 - 33
Therefore, 35 can be written as:
35 = 59 - (57 - 33)
So the equation becomes (59 - 57) + 33.
</think>
<answer>(59 - 57) + 33</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers and basic operations available to me. I need to reach 89 using the numbers 23, 29, and 95 exactly once. 
Starting with 29, if I add 23 to it, I get 52, which is much closer to 89. This seems promising.
Next, I need an additional number that, when applied to 52, gets me to 89. Since 95 is the only number left and it's very close to 89, I consider dividing 52 by 23 (which is 2. 26) and then adding 95.
However, division doesn't give an integer, so that won't work. We need to reconsider how to combine these numbers and operations.
Upon examining again, a possible solution involves using multiplication. If I multiply 23 by 95, I get 2185, which is too large. On the other hand, dividing 29 by 23 gives approximately 1. 26, which is also not exactly what I'm looking for.
Now, one way to get 89 using 29 and 23 is to subtract 29 from 23, which gives -6. We then need to use 95 to reach 89. Adding -6 to 95 gives 89.
So, the equation can be:
23 - 29 + 95 = 89
</think>
<answer> 23 - 29 + 95 </answer>

==============
<think> Given the numbers 84, 4, and 11, we need to form an equation that equals 40 using basic arithmetic operations. One effective way to think about it is to consider if any combination of these numbers, when operated upon, can sum up to 40. 
Considering that 84 is a large number and dividing it by 2 gives us 42, which is close to 40, we might need to use subtracting and division operations. But 11 cannot be divided nicely by a number from the set {84, 4} to result in a suitable number for the next operations. 
The key number is 4. We can use it in a way to adjust the result. One strategy is to think about what we need to subtract from 84 to get a value that, when combined with 4, gives 40.
84 - 44 = 40
So, we need to find a way to get 44 from 84 using only 4 and 11 once. We can subtract 11 from 84 to get 73, and then divide 73 by 4, which doesn't work since it results in 18.75.
Instead, let's consider a different operation:
73 - 33 = 40
Now we just need to generate 33 from 4 and 11:
73 - (4 * 11) = 73 - 44 = 29
This approach doesn't work yet.
A better approach might be:
(84 - 11) = 73
73 / 4 = 18. 25
This result is close, but not correct. Let me try:
84 - 44 = 40
It works out perfectly. So the equation goes as:
84 - 4 * 11 = 40
</think>
<answer> 84 - 4 * 11 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to form the number 68 using three of the four numbers [93, 96, 18, 83] through basic arithmetic operations. 
One thing that stands out is that 83 + 18 = 101, which is close to 68. 
If we subtract a number from 101, we'll get 68. This leads me to think that 93 could be the number to subtract from 101:
101 - 93 = 68.
However, we cannot simply subtract 93 from 101 because 101 isn't present in the given set. 
Instead, we need to use 96 and 18 in some way.
96 - 18 = 78. Now we have 78 and we need to subtract 10 (as 68 - 10 = 58). 
We can obtain 10 from 93 - 83 = 10.
So the final equation will be 96 - 18 - (93 - 83).
</think>
<answer> 96 - 18 - (93 - 83) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find an equation that equals 68 using the set of numbers [93, 96, 18, 83], where each number can only be used once and only basic arithmetic operations can be used.
I notice that 96 and 18 can be combined to get something close to 68 with simple arithmetic. If I subtract 18 from 96, I get 78. From there, I'll need to use the other two numbers to get -10, so when I subtract 10 from 78, I get 68.
Let's check if this can be done:
78 - 10 = 68
Now, to get -10, I think about 93 - 83 = 10.
So this calculation will work:
96 - 18 = 78
78 - 10 = 68
Therefore our equation is:
(96 - 18) - (93 - 83) = 68
</think>
<answer>(96 - 18) - (93 - 83)</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll look at the target number, which is 97, and the numbers we have, 26, 38, 88, and 73. Given that no single number is very close to 97, I need to think about combinations for basic arithmetic operations.
Subtracting and adding combinations of these numbers seems necessary, but none of the standard combinations work out well. Next, I'll consider multiplying and adding or subtracting. Notice that 88 is very close to 97, so subtracting this might be a potential step.
Let's see if this works: 97 - 88 = 9, which is quite far from the target 0. So this doesn't work directly. 
Now, if I consider including 26 and 73, could I get closer? 26 + 73 = 99, which is close but doesn't lead to the exact 97.
Since 88 - 26 = 62, and then I'd need 97 - 62 which equals 35, and adding 73 to get 108. But that takes 73, and 88 - 26 = 62.
If we look at the reverse, perhaps 97 - 62 = 35. Then we need 73 to be multiplied by 5.
Let's check: 88 - 26 = 62; 35 + 73 = 108, which is off.
Considering another possibility, if we take 88 - 26 = 62 and then use 73 and 38, the equation could look like:
(88 - 26) * 5 = 62 * 5 = 310, not 97.
Next, I'll combine 26 and 38 with 73 and 88.
What about (88 - 38 + 26) * 5 = 50 + 26 * 5 = 50 + 130 = 180, not 97.
Considering another possibility, let’s see:

5 * (88 - 73) = 5 * 15 = 75, not 97.

So neither of the current combinations align with 97 exactly. Revisiting the initial consideration, adding numbers or removing through substraction did not work directly.
Lastly, I'll try another approach: (88 - 26) - 38 + 73.
This equates to: 62 - 38 + 73 = 24 + 73 = 97. This works. </think>
<answer>(88 - 26) - 38 + 73</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to use the numbers 69, 90, and 64 to create an equation that equals 85. One possible approach is to use the numbers as the operands of addition or subtraction in such a way that the result is 85.
Considering the values, let's check different combinations:
- Adding or subtracting 69 and 90 doesn't work as it either gives a number too high or too low.
- Then, I considered subtracting or adding 64 from the sum or difference of the other two numbers.
- Subtracting 64 from the sum of 69 and 90 gives 153 - 64 = 89, which is close but too high.
- Adding 64 to the difference between 90 and 69 gives: (90 - 69) + 64 = 21 + 64 = 85.
Hence, the equation that satisfies the conditions is (90 - 69) + 64.
</think>
<answer> (90 - 69) + 64 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll examine the numbers 90, 72, and 26 to figure out a combination that, when operated on using basic arithmetic, equals 44. One useful strategy is to look for a combination that, when subtracted or divided, could be 44 or nearly 44.
- The large number, 90, suggests subtraction or division by it.
- Dividing 90 by any of these numbers will give a result less than 10, not 44.
- So, I'll consider 90 minus a number, like 72, which leaves 18.
- Now, 18 minus the third number, 26, is not enough.
- Let's try 72 divided by the third number.
  - Dividing 72 by 26 gives approximately 2.769, which isn't close to 44.
- Now I'll reconsider. I notice multiplying a smaller number by a larger one could approach 44. Let's consider:
  - 90 divided by 26 gives approximately 3.46, which again is not close enough.
- Revisiting 72/26 suggests I should reconsider 90. If I have 90 - 72 = 18, then 18 * a number should give 44.
  - In this case, 18 * 2. 444... comes close but isn't exact.
- However, 72 * 1. 8 (seventh part of 4 is 1. 8) equals 13. 799 and subtracting 90 from it would be -76. 799.
- Now, I realize 90 - 72 = 18, 18 + 26 = 44. The addition works perfectly.
</think>
<answer> (90 - 72) + 26 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers and the operations we can use to get to 30. Given [75, 10, 95], one part of the equation can be quickly ruled out as 75 cannot be divided by 10 or 95 to reach a smaller number easily. 
Looking at the operations, subtraction and addition are straightforward but yield numbers less than 10 when used with these numbers without another operation.
The most promising operations are multiplication and division. Given 75 is quite large, multiplication with a smaller number (either 10 or 95) doesn't seem to bring us closer to 30.
Trying to divide 75 by 10 gives us 7.5, which when subtracted by 95 would get us -87.5.
Multiplying 10 by 95 gives 950, and when divided by 75 does 12.66. This is also far from 30.
Considering the need to reach 30 using these numbers once, an expression is possible if we can combine them one with another operation.
Let's consider 10 * 3 = 30, if we could form a 3 using the remaining numbers. The only remaining number is 95, and we can't form 3 using 95 and basic operations.
Another combination we can consider is 75 - 95 / 10, but this doesn't simplify to 30.
Upon re-examining 95 - 75 = 20, and possibly 20 + 10 = 30, we see that 95 - 75 = 20 and adding 10 gives us the result of 30.
So, the equation that works is 95 - 75 + 10 = 30.
</think>
<answer> 95 - 75 + 10 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll analyze the numbers and operations we can use. We want to create an equation that equals 75 using the numbers 92, 2, and 15 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations.
One strategy is to consider the inverse functions and how we can reverse the action of the numbers. Note that subtraction and division with smaller numbers can bring the total closer to 75 because they go in reverse (opposite) directions from addition and multiplication.
Starting with the number 92, we can consider reducing it by subtracting or dividing by smaller numbers. Let's try to reduce it by leaving 2 and manipulating 15.
Dividing 92 by 15 doesn't really help as it won't give a clean integer. Subtracting 15 from 92 would give us 77, which is too high. Inverting 15 by adding 2 to it gives 17. Dividing 92 by 17 gives approximately 5.41, not very useful.
Now, let's consider if reversing the operation of subtraction might be helpful. Taking 2 away from 92 gives us 89. Now we need to reduce 89 to 75 by using 15. Subtracting 15 from 89 gives us 74, still not our target.
Continuing, let's try a different direction. We know 75 can be expressed as 92 - 17, which matches our original 92 - 15 + 2. Let's check if this works out mathematically:
92 - 17 = 75
Here, 17 is derived from 15 + 2. 
</think>
<answer> 92 - (15 + 2) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 92, 2, and 15 to create an equation equal to 75. I can use the operations +, -, * and /. Given that 92 is quite far from 75, subtracting or dividing may not help immediately. Let's look at possible combinations:
- Starting with 92: 92 - 15 - 2 = 75 (This works, but uses all of the numbers)
- Considering 92 and 2, the remaining is 90 - 75 = 15, which can be achieved by subtraction, but this does not use the number 15 directly.
- 92 / 2 + 15 = 46 + 15 = 61 (This is too high)
- Any other combinations of operations on 92 and 2 will not lead to 75 without repeating number usage or introducing non-allowed characters.
Therefore, the only possible combination uses 92 - 15 - 2 directly, leaving 15 unused.
</think>
<answer> (92 - 15 - 2)</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider that the target number 62 can only be reached by combining the given numbers [41, 17, 4] using basic arithmetic operations. 
Since 62 - 41 = 21, let's try to reach 21 using the numbers 17 and 4. 
Multiplication or division won't work, as it would make it too small or too large. 
Subtraction doesn't work, as 4 - 17 = -13.
This leaves addition as a potential operation. 
17 + 4 = 21. So, we discovered that we need 41 + (17 + 4).
The final equation will be 41 + (17 + 4) = 62.
</think>
<answer> 41 + (17 + 4) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use the numbers 61, 2, and 31 to create an equation that equals 28. 
Looking at the numbers, it seems necessary to use subtraction and a division to reach the target. 
Considering 61 - 31 = 30, which is close to 28. 
Next, I need to adjust this result to get to 28. Using the remaining number 2, I see that 30 - 2 = 28. 
Therefore, the equation is: (61 - 31) - 2 = 28. </think>
<answer>(61 - 31) - 2</answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that uses the numbers [46, 92, 6] and equals 40, let's consider the possible combinations of arithmetic operations:
- Multiplication or division of the numbers themselves won't easily lead us to 40.
- Considering addition or subtraction and how to manipulate the numbers 6, 46, 92.
Using 6, we can think about manipulation to combine or compare it with 46 or 92. 
92 can be broken down as 62 + 30; the 30 can be obtained by subtracting 46 from 92. But that doesn't give us 40.
46 + 6 = 52 and 92 - 6 = 86 both don't yield 40.
However, if we consider the order of operations and the fact that we're looking for 40, we can try subtracting 92 - 46 - 6. 
Let's check this:
92 - 46 - 6 = 40.
This gives us a value of 40 using all the numbers once and the basic arithmetic operation of subtraction.</think>
<answer>92 - 46 - 6</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's examine the numbers we have: 10, 7, and 23. We need to use each number exactly once and only combine them using basic arithmetic operations to reach a sum of 69.
We see that 23 is already close to our target. Let's see if we can work from there.
Multiplying 23 by 3 gives us 69, which is what we want. So, 23 * 3 = 69.
This means we need to find a way to create a 3 using the numbers 10 and 7.
Remember, these numbers can be combined using the allowed arithmetic operations. One way to get a 3 is by doing 10 - 7 = 3.
Therefore, we've split our equation into two parts: 23 * (10 - 7) = 69.
</think>
<answer>23 * (10 - 7)</answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to create an equation that equals 98 using the numbers 16, 71, and 43, with each number being used exactly once.
Looking at the numbers available, 71 seems to be close to 98. So we might think about subtracting or adding from 71 or multiplying and dividing by other numbers.
We can subtract 16 from 71, which equals 55. 
Now we need to find a way to get from 55 to 43, then it's just a matter of dividing 43 by the difference to get 98.
So 71 - 16 = 55, and 43 / (55 - 43) = 43 / 12 = 3. 5833, which is obviously not 98.
Now, considering addition, if we add our remaining numbers together, 43 + 16 = 59.
We then need to find out how to end up with 98 from 59.
The process might need some adjustment. Consider if there's a better method to work directly to 98.
In fact, if we start with 71 and think about combining with 43 to reach 98, doing 71 + 43 gives us 114.
Now we need to subtract 16 to get 98: 114 - 16 = 98.
Trying out the operations, the full equation would be: 71 + 43 - 16 = 98.
</think>
<answer> (71 + 43) - 16 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: [17, 25, 43, 17]. We are looking for a way to use these numbers only once each to get a result of 68.
We have repeated numbers (17 and 25), so those might be useful in our calculation. Let's try adding 17 and 43 together. That gives us 60.
Now, to get from 60 to 68, we need to add 8. Our third number, 25, can be helpful here, as 25 - 17 = 8.
So, the equation becomes: (17 + 43) + (25 - 17) which simplifies to 60 + 8 = 68.
</think>
<answer> (17 + 43) + (25 - 17) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to examine the numbers provided: 18, 28, and 37. I want to form an equation using these numbers exactly once that equals 47. I should start with an operation that will bring me closer to 47 without exceeding it.
Looking at the numbers:
- 28 is relatively close to 47.
- 18 is smaller than 28 but may be useful for adjusting the value.
- 37 is larger than 28.
I'll subtract 18 from 28, as it's the closest operation to reach the target:
28 - 18 = 10
Then, I need to reach from 10 to 47. Adding 37 will get me there:
10 + 37 = 47
Thus, the equation is 28 - 18 + 37 = 47.

<answer>28 - 18 + 37</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to consider how I can get 54 from the numbers 6, 27, and 75 using basic arithmetic operations. One way to approach this is to isolate the number 75 and then use the other two numbers to reach 54. 
75 - 21 = 54. So, we need to find out how to get 21 using 6 and 27. We can use the operation 27 - 6 = 21.
Now we have:
75 - (27 - 6) = 54.
</think>
<answer> 75 - (27 - 6) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the given numbers: 74, 58, 63. We want to create an equation that equals 79 using these numbers exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations.
One way to solve this is to consider what we can do with the numbers 74 and 58. If we subtract 58 from 74, we get 16. Now we need a way to get to 79 from 16 using the remaining number 63.
We can reach 79 by adding 63 and 16. This gives us the equation: 63 + (74 - 58) = 79.
Let's verify this:
63 + (74 - 58) = 63 + 16 = 79.
So the equation is correct.
</think>
<answer> 63 + (74 - 58) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll note that using division or multiplication would make it difficult to reach 34 without exceeding or going below the range of the numbers given. Therefore, I'll consider using addition and subtraction.
The target number is 34, and we start with the numbers 56, 5, and 95.
I notice that 95 - 5 = 90 is very close to 34, but not quite it.
If I subtract 56 from 95, I get 39, way more than 34. That won't work.
So I'll try something else.
Now, 95 - 56 = 39, which is too big, but if I use subtraction on smaller numbers, how about 56 - 5 = 51? Still too large.
Subtracting again, 56 - (5 - 5) = 56, again wrong.
This gives an idea that we are close to the target when we manipulate smaller numbers.
Let's try 5 + 5 = 10, now we have 34 left to reach. Clearly, 56 - 10 = 46, but 46 < 34.
We need something smaller to reach 34. One idea is 95 - 56 - 5.
Calculating: 95 - 56 - 5 = 34, which equals our target.
Thus, the equation is 95 - 56 - 5 = 34.
</think>
<answer> 95 - 56 - 5 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 62 using the numbers 79, 42, and 59. 
Considering each operation to be used only once, starting with the subtraction:
79 - 42 = 37 (this gives us our closest number to 62, leaving us 25 to reach 62)
Then, 37 + 59 = 96 (but this is too large)
Therefore, I can't achieve 62 with the number 59 using these operations alone.
Instead, let's consider addition and subtraction together:
79 - 42 + 59 = 96 (which is too large again)
However, if I reverse the order and try 79 + 42 - 59:
79 + 42 = 121
Then 121 - 59 = 62
So the equation becomes: 79 + 42 - 59 = 62
</think>
<answer> 79 + 42 - 59 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation using the numbers 23, 25, and 98 that equals 100, I need to consider how I can manipulate these numbers with basic arithmetic operations.
One way to do this could be to use multiplication and addition since 98 is relatively close to 100. 
If I start with 98 and add 2, I get 100. So, 98 + 2 = 100.
Now I need to create the '2' from the other two numbers.
25 - 23 = 2.
Therefore, the equation can be constructed in two parts: using 98 + (25 - 23), which will give 98 + 2 = 100.
</think>
<answer> 98 + (25 - 23) </answer>

==============
<think> I want an equation that equals 56 using the numbers 55, 44, and 44. Let's start by thinking about what we need to do. 
56 is close to 55, which is one of the numbers. One way to achieve this would be by using subtraction.
If we subtract one 44 from 55, we get 11. Then we need to multiply this 11 by 5 to get 55. So we need 55 and another 44 to work with.
Now, we have 44, which is exactly what we need. If we take 44 and subtract 11 (which is 44/4), we will get 33. Now we need to multiply this 33 by 5 to get 55: 33 * 5 = 165, but this is not right.
Instead, we should keep all numbers and operations to the minimum. Multiplying 44 by 5 gives us 220, which is too large.
So, the solution must involve using 44 in a multiplication and involving 55 in the addition or subtraction.
If we keep 55 as it is and use multiplication with 44, we should find a way to get 11 or 5. If we take 44/44 = 1, then 55 + 1 = 56.
Therefore, the equation can be (55 + 44 / 44) = 56.
</think>
<answer>(55 + 44 / 44)</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 39, 94, and 11 that equals 44. I should try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, ensuring each number is used only once.
1. Multiplying 11 by 4 gives 44, which is our target. However, I need to express 4 using 39 and 94.
2. Looking at the numbers, I see that 94 - 39 = 55. This is close, but I need 4.
3. I can use division to correct this. Dividing 55 by 13.33 (which is 55 / 11) would give 5, which again is not 4.
4. Now, I notice something else. If I have 94 - 55 = 39, it means I need to subtract 50 from 94 to get 44.
5. I've already calculated 94 - 39 = 55. So I just need to subtract 11 from 55 to get 44.
Therefore, the equation that uses 39, 94, and 11 to equal 44 is 94 - 39 - 11. </think>
<answer> 94 - 39 - 11 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider what we need to do to get from the given numbers to 44. We could start by looking at the numbers 94 and 39, since 94 - 39 = 55, which is quite close to 44.
We need to subtract 11 to get to 44, but using 11 directly isn't possible as it must be used exactly once.
94 - 39 = 55, now we need to get to 44 by subtracting 11. This can be done by 55 - 11.
So, our equation will be 94 - 39 - 11 = 44.
</think>
<answer> 94 - 39 - 11 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I should identify a combination that produces a result close to 57 starting with the largest number (81) and considering the possible operations. Using multiplication and addition might provide the correct result. Let's see: 81 - 28 = 53. Now, we need an extra 4 to reach 57. Since 75 is the next largest, 75 - 71 = 4. So, we can combine these:
75 - 71 + (81 - 28) = 57
</think>
<answer> 75 - 71 + (81 - 28) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's note that 83 is quite a large number and will likely help achieve the result if combined with the smaller numbers 28 and 4 in a certain way.
Considering division and addition, we might use the larger numbers for the division or the smaller numbers for the sum, and then adjust with the remaining calculation.
We need to get 51, and 83 - 32 = 51, but none of our numbers are 32. So 83 - 28 - 4 could be a possibility.
This means using 83 as the starting number, subtract 28 and then subtract 4.
The calculation would be: 83 - 28 - 4 = 51. </think>
<answer> 83 - 28 - 4 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 76, 97, and 88 to equal 85. Let's explore possible combinations.
One way to approach this is to start with the largest number, 97, because it's the closest to 85, and then adjust with the other numbers.
Using 97, we can subtract 12 from it to get 85:
97 - 12 = 85
Now, we need to find how to create 12 using the other two numbers, 76 and 88.
A possible option is to use multiplication and division to get 12:
88 / 76 = 1. 16279069767442 (which is not 12)
Another option is to look at how these numbers can be arranged to produce 12.
We can break 12 into 10 + 2. 10 can be 88 - 76 which gives us exactly 12.
So the equation is:
97 - (88 - 76) = 85
</think>
<answer> 97 - (88 - 76) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers available: 85, 34, and 8. We need to combine these numbers using basic arithmetic operations to get 59. 

Looking at 85 and 34, if we subtract these directly, we get:
85 - 34 = 51, which is not what we want.

Next, let's see what happens if we subtract 34 from 85 and then add 8:
85 - 34 + 8 = 59.
This gives us the target number 59. Therefore, the operation must be 85 - 34 + 8. </think>
<answer> (85 - 34) + 8 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll analyze the numbers given: 79, 71, and 95. Notice that 95 - 79 = 16. This gives us a clue. Now, combining this with 71, we have 71 - 16 = 55. Thus, the equation can involve these numbers to achieve this difference.
So, the equation steps are:
71 - 16 = 55
Since we have to use all the numbers provided, we can rearrange 16 to be 95 - 79. Thus, rearranging 71 - 16 to 71 - (95 - 79) is legal.
Therefore, the equation is: 71 - (95 - 79) = 55
</think>
<answer> 71 - (95 - 79) </answer>

==============
<think> We are given three numbers: 79, 71, and 95. We need to use these numbers along with basic arithmetic operations to get the result of 55. Each number can only be used once.
First, let's add 79 and 71:
79 + 71 = 150
This gives us a larger number than we need, so we will subtract one of the numbers. Let's try subtracting 95:
150 - 95 = 55
This gives us our desired result. Both 79 and 71 have been used in this equation.
Thus, the equation we need is:
150 - 95 = 55
</think>
<answer> (79 + 71) - 95 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to get a result of 11 using the numbers 70, 20, and 39. A good starting point is to consider the subtraction which often can yield simpler numbers that are easier to work with. I'll start by looking at subtracting 39 from 70 first.
70 - 39 = 31
Now I have to reach a result of 11 using 31 and 20. I see that if I subtract 20 from 31, I will get 11:
31 - 20 = 11
So the equation becomes:
70 - 39 - 20 = 11
</think>
<answer> (70 - 39 - 20) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that results in 44 using the numbers 67, 15, and 96. One way to get to 44 by adding or subtracting these numbers is by noticing that 15 + 96 = 111. Then, I would need to subtract 67 from 111 to get 44. This uses each number exactly once. </think>
<answer> 15 + 96 - 67 </answer>

==============
<think> I have the numbers 26, 66, and 1 available, and the goal is to reach a total of 93 using basic arithmetic operations. Starting with these numbers, 66 is quite large, and 1 is small. 26 seems to be a key number to work with.
First, I'll use the division operation to manipulate 66 and 1. Dividing 66 by 1 gives me 66. Now I have 66 and 26.
Next, I see that if I've 66 and 26, I can add them to quickly approach 93. Indeed, 66 + 26 = 92. However, I need 93, so I must add another 1 to get to 93.
So, my equation would be: (66 + 26) + 1 = 93.
</think>
<answer>(66 + 26) + 1</answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation with the numbers 20, 2, and 77 that equals 59. I should start by considering which numbers can be used in addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division to achieve the target number. 
First, I notice that 77 is quite close to 59, which might be useful. Subtracting 20 from 77 gives 57, which is close to 59. Then, adding 2 to 57 gives 59, which is exactly what we need. So the sequence of operations appears to be 77 - 20 + 2 = 59.
</think>
<answer> (77 - 20) + 2 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list out the numbers we have: 33, 38, 39, and 52.
To get to 86, one possible combination could be adding 33 and 52 and then subtracting 38. 
33 + 52 = 85
85 - 38 = 47
It looks like we're short by 39. If we add 39 to 47, we'll reach 86.
So, the calculation would be:
33 + 52 - 38 + 39 = 86
</think>
<answer> (33 + 52 - 38) + 39 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's examine the numbers we have: 78, 37, 13, and 65.
To make 11, we need a sum or a difference of 11. 
Among the numbers, 65 is the largest and 13 is the smallest, so we might consider operations involving these two numbers.
If we use the number 13, we can work with the other numbers around it:
13 - 65 = -52, which isn't helpful.
If we consider the structure (65 - 37), we get 28.
Now, if we use 78, the equation becomes (65 - 37) + 78.
However, 78 + 28 = 106, which is too big.
Let's try a subtraction involving 78: 
65 - (37 - 13) = 65 - 24 = 41, which is still not 11.
We need to reconsider the order: 
(78 - 65) + 37 - 13 might work.
Let's compute this:
78 - 65 = 13
13 + 37 = 50
50 - 13 = 37, this isn't 11.
We still haven't found the correct combination. 
Now let's try: 
(78 - 65) - (37 - 13) = 13 - 24 = -11. 
This is one less than 11. Adding 13 will give us 11:
-11 + 13 = 2, which is not 11.
Finally, let's try:
(78 - 65) - (37 - 13) + 13 = 13 - 24 + 13 = -11 + 13 = 2.
This still isn't 11. 
Therefore, the correct calculation is:
65 - (78 - 37) = 65 - 41 = 24,
24 - 13 = 11. 
</think>
<answer> 65 - (78 - 37) - 13 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll examine the numbers 61, 27, and 31. The goal is to use each of these numbers exactly once and apply basic arithmetic operations to reach the target number 57.
I notice that 61 is quite close to 57, which means subtraction or addition is probably involved.
Considering 31, it's a number which might be subtracted or added to 61 to make use of the remaining 27.
Subtracting 31 from 61 gives 30. Now we have 27 and 30. The difference between 30 and 27 is 3, so adding 27 to 3 gives 30.
So, to get to 57, we can start with 30 and add 27, and we know 30 is 61 - 31.
Therefore, the equation is: (61 - 31) + 27 = 57.
</think>
<answer>(61 - 31) + 27</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to come up with an equation using the numbers 61, 69, and 89 that equals 81. Let's break down the numbers: 61, 69, and 89. We should consider operations that can help us get closer to 81.
- If I subtract 69 from 89, I get: 89 - 69 = 20.
- Then if I add 61 to 20, I get: 61 + 20 = 81.
- This means we can use the equation: 61 + (89 - 69) = 81.
</think>
<answer> 61 + (89 - 69) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll analyze the numbers we have: 16, 19, and 55. We need to arrange them using basic arithmetic operations to get 58.
16 + 19 = 35
16 + 55 = 71
19 + 55 = 74
None of these combinations directly give us 58.
16 - 19 = -3
16 - 55 = -39
19 - 55 = -36
None of these combinations directly give us 58 either.
Let's try different operations on these:
19 - 16 = 3
Now, 55 - 3 = 52
This gets us close to 58.
So, the equation becomes:
55 - 3 + 19 = 58
</think>
<answer> (55 - 16) + 19 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 16, 19, and 55 that equals 58. Each number can only be used once.
If I look at the numbers, I can see that 55 is the largest and could potentially be used as a subtraction or addition base point since it doesn't directly match 58 or result in 58 through standard operations.
I see that 19 could be subtracted from 55 to get 36, but that doesn't help because it's still too high and we need to reduce to reach 58.
Then I see that 16, when subtracted from 19, gets me to 3, which is a number I can use.
So, I use 19 - 16 = 3.
Now I have 55 - 3 = 52 left to get to 58. That means we need 6 more. Since I need to get the remaining 6 from the given numbers and 35 (55 - 16) is close, I can swap out 16 with 55 - (19 - 3) = 55 - 16.
So, 55 - (19 - 16) = 55 - 19 + 16 = 52.
To get 58, we need 6 more, and since 52 is 6 away from 58, we add 6, which comes from 19 - 13, but since we can't get 13 from the given numbers (16, 19, 55), we need to rethink.
Thinking again, 19 - 13 can't be solved with our numbers directly, but we can use 19 - 13 = 6 by borrowing a 10 and adding 10 to 16 to get 13, and we end up subtracting 13 from 55 which leaves us with 52, afterwards adding 6 results in 58.
So the equation seems to be:
55 - 19 + 16 + 19 - 13 = 58
But the equation should use only the numbers 16, 19, and 55 once.
So, another equation we can try is combining 19 - 16 = 3 and then using 19 and 55 to get 58:
55 + (19 - 16) = 55 + 3 = 58
This gives us the correct result of 58 using all the numbers only once.
</think>
<answer> 55 + (19 - 16) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider how the numbers 49, 51, and 18 can be manipulated using arithmetic operations to reach 82.
- Adding or subtracting these numbers manually doesn't seem to get us close to 82.
- Multiplication and division with these numbers don't easily lead to 82 either.
- A useful insight might be to consider the operations or manipulations that might yield something useful.
- Notice that 49 + 18 = 67, which puts us closer to 82.
- To achieve 82, we need an additional 15. Since we used 67 as a sum of 49 and 18, we need to harness the remaining 51 to get 15.
- 51 - 36 (which is 6 * 6) = 15.
But the issue is, we haven't used all numbers. Instead let's check another possibility:
- We can use 51 - 18 = 33 and then add 49 to reach 82.
- 33 + 49 = 82
So, the equation we're looking for is 51 - 18 + 49 = 82.
</think>
<answer> 51 - 18 + 49 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers provided: 78, 65, and 82. Our goal is to create an equation that equals 61 using these numbers only once.
The number 61 is a bit smaller than both 78 and 82, so it might be obtained by subtracting from one of these or by some combination. Let's look at combining 78 and 65 first:
- We can't get 61 by adding 78 and 65 because 78 + 65 = 143
- If we try 78 - 65 = 13, that's not the target number. 
Now let's try 82 and 65:
- 82 - 65 = 17, which isn't our target either.
We should try subtracting 65 from 82:
- 82 - 65 = 17, not 61.
Finally, let's try subtracting 78 from 82:
- 82 - 78 = 4, still not our target.
Given the above failures, let's consider mixing the numbers using multiplication and subtraction:
- If we take 82 and multiply by 78, we get 6236 which is too large.
If we try 78 and 65 and think about another operation, 78 * 65 = 5070 which is also too large.
One final option might be to consider using division:
- 82 / 78 (~1.051) is not a target.
While none of the straightforward combinations work, let's try taking numbers in different orders:
- 78 - 65 = 13
- 82 - 13 = 69
- Now, subtracting 13 from 69 gets us to 56
- Subtracting 13 again gets us to 43 
None of these work either. 
However, I remember trying combinations:
(82 - 78 = 4) and then performing the inverse operation to get close to 61, but then we need to adjust.
(65 / 1 = 65) and then subtracting or adding to get 61 is wrong.
Finally, it strikes me that (82 - 65 = 17) isn't working and considering:
(78 + 65 - 82 = 61) is the solution.
It follows that 78 + 65 - 82 equals 61.
</think>
<answer> (78 + 65) - 82 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to create an equation that uses the numbers 78, 65, and 82 and results in 61. We need to use each number only once.
We can start with subtraction:
- Subtract 78 from 82: 82 - 78 = 4
- Now we have 65 and 4.
- We need to use these numbers strategically to reach 61.
- Let's consider if there's any way we can adjust these easily. 
- We can observe that 65 - 4 = 61.
So, we have 65 - (82 - 78) = 61.
</think>
<answer> 65 - (82 - 78) </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to create an equation from the numbers 66, 5, and 5 that equals 76. We have the basic arithmetic operations at our disposal: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
- Let's start by checking for combinations that can get us close to 76 using 5 and 5.
- Then we need to incorporate the 66 in such a way that we reach 76.
- We notice that 66 is quite close to 76, so we should try to use the numbers to make a combination that, when added or subtracted, will hit the number 76.
- Considering multiplication and division, we realize that using 5 as a divisor or to be multiplied with 6 to approach a centesimal unit might help, but it might complicate our equation.
- The closest we can get to 76 using operations with 5 and 66 without introducing fractions or decimal values is by trying something like addition or subtraction.
- We see that 66 + 5 = 71 which is not 76.
- Now let's try another possibility: (66 - 5) = 61, not 76 either.
- Let's try a different approach where we use division: (66 / 5) would give us 13.2, which isn't an integer and will not directly help us get to 76.
- Now, let's think of a way to use the numbers and operations creatively to get nearer to 76:
  - We can use 66 as is, since 66 is more than 76, so we need to get closer by subtracting a value.
  - Notice that if we get close to 76, we can add 1 to it to get exactly 76. 
  - Here's the solution: 66 - 5 - 5 = 56, now we need 20 more to reach 76; we can get this by adding 5 to 15, but since we need to use only the available numbers once, it's 66 - 5 - 5 + 5 + 1 = 71.
- The closest to our target is 66 - 5 = 61, we can get closer by: 66 - 5 = 61 and just adding 5 will overshoot. The correct approach is directly using: 66 - 5 + 5 = 66.
- But we then need to adjust for 76, so we end up with 66 + 5 = 71, needing 5 more, we use 5 as 5.
- Thus, we approach 76 directly by 66 + 5 + 5 = 76.
</think>
<answer> 66 + 5 + 5 </answer>

<think> To create an equation that equals 79 using the numbers 57, 33, and 55 with each number used only once, we should examine the possibilities with basic arithmetic operations.
One suggestion might be to subtract or add the two smaller numbers to reach closer to 79 when combined with the largest number.
Let's test an operation:
If we subtract 33 from 57, we get 24. Now we need 55 + another number to equal 79. Clearly, 55 + 24 = 79.
Therefore, the equation we're looking for is 57 - 33 + 55.
</think>
<answer> 57 - 33 + 55 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers [37, 73, 46] and combine them using basic arithmetic operations to get 10. The first thought is to look for a combination of these numbers that will naturally sum up to 10. Let's try combinations by operation:
1. Addition: 
   - (37 + 73) = 110 (This is too big, can't get to 10).
   - 46 + (37 - 73) = -30 (This gives a negative number, can't work).
2. Subtraction:
   - 73 - 37 = 36 (This is too big).
   - 46 - (73 - 37) = 46 - 36 = 10 (This might work! ).
3. Multiplication and Division:
   - 37 * 73 / 46 can be quite large (over 60), so it won't help.
   - Dividing 37 by 73 or 46 won't give an integer that we need.
   - Likewise, multiplying 73 by 46 overcomes the need, leading to bigger numbers.
So, the only viable option left is 46 - (73 - 37) = 10.
</think>
<answer> 46 - (73 - 37) </answer>

<think> First, let's consider the target value we need to reach: 93. The numbers we have are 28, 59, 10, and 72. We can start by adding some of these numbers to approach the target value. The most significant numbers are 59 and 72, since they bring us closer to 93. Let's check if adding 59 and 72 gives us what we need:
59 + 72 = 131
131 is too large since it overshoots our target. Now, let's try subtracting 28 and 10 from 131:
131 - 28 - 10 = 93
This operation works. Now, we need to show this in an equation using the given numbers.
</think>
<answer> (59 + 72) - 28 - 10 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a combination of the numbers 28, 59, 10, and 72 that equals 93 using basic arithmetic operations. One effective approach is to test different ways of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing these numbers.
I can start by checking if the sum of two of the numbers can get close to 93. For instance, 59 + 34 = 93, but 34 is not in the set of given numbers. 
Next, I look for smaller combinations. Using 59 and 34 suggests that I need another number to make up for the difference (59 - 25 = 34). I only have three numbers left (28, 10, 72), so 25 can't be a linear combination of these.
Consider that 93 - 59 = 34, so 59 + 34 = 93, again suggesting we need 34. We see that 72 - 38 = 34, and of the remaining numbers, 28 + 10 = 38. 
Thus, 72 - (28 + 10) = 72 - 38 = 34, and 59 + 34 = 93.
</think>
<answer> 59 + 72 - 28 - 10 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the equation I need to construct using the numbers 50, 74, and 77 to give a result of 47.
I have to use basic arithmetic operators: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
I should start by checking if a simple combination of the numbers can give me 47. 
77 - 74 = 3
Now, using this value of 3, I need to subtract from or add to 50 to get 47.
50 - 3 = 47
So, the equation I'm looking for has to be 50 - (77 - 74).
Let's confirm if this equation is correct using a straightforward calculation.
</think>
<answer> 50 - (77 - 74) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to combine the numbers 63, 61, and 77 using basic arithmetic operations to get 75. 
First, let's look at the differences between 63 and 61, which is 2. 
Similarly, 77 minus 63 is 14. 
The difference of 14 could be useful in getting to 75 by subtraction or addition.
If we take 75 - 14 = 61, which is one of our original numbers. This suggests we could use this in a subtraction operation.
To get from 61 back to 63, we need to subtract 2, which we know is the difference between these two numbers. 
So, if we start with: 77 - (63 - 61) = ?
This gives us: 77 - (63 - 61) = 77 - 2 = 75.
So, the equation is 77 - (63 - 61) = 75.
</think>
<answer>77 - (63 - 61)</answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 51, 21, and 30 to create an equation that equals 42. Let's try combining them using basic arithmetic operations.
First, let's look at the numbers available. We have 51, 21, and 30. We can start by looking at which operations might help us get closer to 42. 
Notice that 51 and 30 are both quite close to 42, so we can start by considering subtraction or addition involving 51 and 30.
51 - 30 = 21
This gives us 21, which is one of the numbers we have, so now we need 21 more to reach 42.
21 - 21 = 0
This operation gives us 0, meaning we can add 0 to our equation without changing its value. This step integrates perfectly with our existing calculation because 51 - 30 = 21, and adding 21 brings us to 42.
Thus, our equation is 51 - 30 + 21 = 42.
</think>
<answer> (51 - 30) + 21 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using 90, 18, and 11 that equals 83, using each number only once and the basic arithmetic operations.
If I add 90 and 11, I get 101, which is pretty close to 83, but too high. If I subtract 18 from 90, I get 72, which is closer to 83. 
To get from 72 to 83, I should add 11 (since the allowed operations can include + and the numbers are each to be used only once).
Therefore, (90 - 18) + 11 = 72 + 11 = 83.
</think>
<answer>(90 - 18) + 11</answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 24, 74, and 23 to create an equation that results in 27. First, I should check if any of the numbers can be combined using basic arithmetic to reach close to 27. 
- Subtracting 23 from 74 gives me 51.
- Then I can subtract 24 from 51 which gives me 27.
Thus, the equation would be (74 - 23) - 24.
</think>
<answer> (74 - 23) - 24 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll look at the numbers provided: 81, 98, 6, and 36. The goal is to create an equation using only these numbers once each that equals 11.
- 11 is a relatively small number, so we might need subtraction or division to reach this.
- 6 and 36 immediately suggest a division action since 36 / 6 = 6.
- We're left with 81 and 98. 
- By subtracting 81 from 98 yields 17.
- It's not immediately clear how 17 relates to 11, but we can explore combinations using 17 and the 6 that remains.
- Multiplying 17 by 36/81 seems promising because it could potentially yield 98/6 or fractions leading us to 11.
Let's check: (98 / 6) * (36 / 81) = 16.44, which is not 11.
Using division inversely, (98 - 81) * (36 / 6) = 7 * 6 = 42, far from 11.
Considering (98 / 81) * (6 / 36) = 1.2047, again too large.
Instead, let's try: 98 - (81 * (6 / 36)) = 98 - (81 * 1/6) = 98 - 13.5, which gives 84.5.
Next, let's see: (98 - 81) / (36 / 6) = 17 / 6 = 2.8333, not right.
Let's now consider: (98 - 81) * (6 / 36) = 6 * 1/6 = 1. And we have 81 left, so let's try to subtract 63 from it: 81 - 63 = 18.
Now, (98 - 81) / (81 - 63) = 6 / 18 = 1/3, which isn't 11 neither.
Considering a correct inverse operation now, let's try a combination: 98 - 81 - (36 / 6) = 17 - 6 = 11.
This gives us the equation: 98 - 81 - (36 / 6) = 11. This works, and all numbers are used only once.
</think>
<answer> 98 - 81 - (36 / 6) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to use the numbers 53, 38, and 47 to get to 62. Since 62 is close to 53, I should consider subtracting or adding this number to reach 62. Let's start by subtracting 53 from 62: 62 - 53 = 9. Now, I need another number to reach 9 using 38 and 47.
Looking at the remaining numbers, adding 38 and 47 gives 85, which is too much. Subtracting 38 from 47 gives 9, which brings me to the number 9 that I need.
So, the equation can be 47 - 38 + 53 = 62.
</think>
<answer> 47 - 38 + 53 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 19, 48, and 68 to create an equation that equals 97. Let's start by considering if any of these numbers can be subtracted or added to get closer to 97. Adding the smaller numbers might make it easier. 48 + 19 = 67, which is not 97. 68 - 19 = 49, which is closer to 97. Now, we need to get from 49 to 97. If we add 48 to 49, we get 97. So the equation will be: 49 + 48 = 97. However, we only have the number 49 with the available numbers, so we need to reconsider using the other numbers. Subtracting 49 from 68, we get 19, and then we need to add 48 to get 67, which isn't 97. Multiplying and dividing between the numbers doesn't seem to lead anywhere close to getting to 97.
</think>
<answer> 68 - 19 + 48 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the target value we need to reach, which is 80. We have the numbers 67, 68, and 79 available.
- If we just add 67 + 68, we get 135, which is already too high.
- Subtracting 67 from 79 gives us 12, which is too low.
- 79 - 68 = 11, which is still short but gives us a clue.
- If we use 68 and add 12, we get 80.
Since we can only use 67 and 79 and none of them by themselves get us to 12, let's see if combining them with arithmetic operations can give us 12.
- 68 - 79 = -11, which is not useful.
- Adding these, 67 + 79 = 146, which is too high.
- Subtracting, 79 - 67 = 12, which could work.
So, we need to use 68 + (79 - 67).
This gives us 68 + 12 = 80, which is our target.
</think>
<answer> 68 + (79 - 67) </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation using the numbers 68, 92, and 50 that equal 74 with each number used only once and basic arithmetic operations, I'll examine the numbers and operations.
First, I consider the possibility of subtracting. 92 - 68 = 24. This doesn't use the 50 number and doesn't come close to 74.
Next, I think about multiplication and division. 92 * 0. 1 = 9. 2, but 50 * 0. 1 = 5, and neither of these lead us to 74.
If I add or subtract, I can't get from 24 to 74 using 50. I need to think of a combination.
I consider 92 - 50 = 42. Now I have 42 and 68 left to reach 74.
If I add 68 + 42 = 100, which is too large. It seems I need to subtract to reach 74.
So, I calculate 92 - 50 = 42, and then 92 - 42 = 50, but now I've used 50 already. The pattern here might be to use subtraction and addition.
I realize that I need to rearrange the subtraction and addition in a new way. I see that 92 - 68 = 24 and then surprisingly, 50 + 24 = 74.
Therefore, the equation is 92 - 68 + 50 = 74.
</think>
<answer> 92 - 68 + 50 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider all the possible combinations of using the numbers 68, 92, and 50 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain 74. 
The quick observation shows that using the subtraction operation between 92 and 68 could bring me closer to 74 since 92 - 68 = 24.
Now, if I could somehow reduce 24 to 74, it seems challenging with standard arithmetic operations. 
But looking at the remaining number 50, I can try multiplication or division with 24 to get it closer to 74. 
Multiplying 24 by 50 gives 1200, which is much too large. 
Dividing 74 by 24 also doesn't work since it's not an integer.
The only feasible option remaining is to see if addition or subtraction of 50 to or from 24 can yield 74. 
50 - 24 yields 26, which is not equal to 74.
50 + 24 yields 74, which is exactly what we need! 
So, the equation we get is 50 + (92 - 68) = 74. </think>
<answer> 50 + (92 - 68) </answer>

==============
<think> The goal is to construct an equation using the numbers 70, 58, 28, 99 to equal 83. 
Let's start by considering how the numbers might combine to reach 83. We notice that 99 and 58 are quite close to 157, or the difference between 2 and 159. Subtracting a smaller number from 99 could work.
First, calculate 99 - 58 = 41.
Next, we need to get from 41 to 83. We add 42 to 41 to reach 83.
Finally, we recognize we can get 42 from 58 - 16, but we don't have 16 in the set. This means instead, we need to think about using 28 and 70 to achieve this subtraction.
Let's see, 70 - 28 = 42.
So we put it all together: 99 - (58 - (70 - 28)) = 99 - (58 - 42) = 99 - 16 = 83.
</think>
<answer> 99 - (58 - (70 - 28)) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's assess the numbers we have: 84, 87, and 72. We need to combine these numbers to get a result of 99. 
Examining the numbers, we see that 87 - 72 = 15. This is close, but not there yet. 
Now, 99 - 15 = 84. So we have the numbers 84, 87, and 72, and can now combine them as follows: 87 - 72 + 84 = 99.
</think>
<answer> 87 - 72 + 84 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 84, 87, and 72 to form an equation that equals 99. First, I'll consider the operations we can use: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). The numbers should be utilized just once.
Let's start by checking if there's a combination of these numbers yielding 99:
- 87 + 72 = 159 (too high)
- 87 - 72 = 15 (too low)
- 84 + 72 = 156 (too high)
- 87 * 72 = 6264 (way too high)
- 84 * 72 = 6048 (way too high)
- 87 / 72 = 1.208... (too low, not an integer solution)
- 84 / 72 = 1.166... (smaller, splitting doesn't help)
Since direct arithmetic operations are not yielding a suitable number, let's try rearranging:
Combining 87 and 72 could give 87 - 72 = 15. Then, we need 99 - 15 = 84. We can see 84 is one of our original numbers - we have a match!
Therefore, the equation is:
87 - 72 + 84 = 99
</think>
<answer> 87 - 72 + 84 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to create an equation that uses the numbers 30, 84, and 2 to equal 52. 
Looking at each number, we see that 84 is relatively large and could potentially be broken down or acted upon to reach 52. 
84 - 30 = 54, which is close to 52. 
If we want to get to 52, we can subtract or add a small number. 
Since 2 is the smallest number and easily possible to add and reach 52, we can consider using 2 to get to the target:
84 - 30 - 2 = 52
</think>
<answer> (84 - 30 - 2)</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll look at the numbers: 29, 26, 67, and 88. We need to create an equation that uses these numbers only once to get 24. 
Given the numbers, it seems likely that subtraction and addition will allow us to manipulate the numbers effectively. The number 67 might be a key to finding the right numbers to add/subtract.
Let's try subtracting 26 from 67: 
67 - 26 = 41
Now we have 29 and 41. We need to use these to get to 24 using 88. If we add 29 to 88:
88 + 29 = 117
This is not 24. But, let's adjust by trying another operation. We need 24, and we have 41. 
If we divide 41 by 1.75 (which is 7/4, a common fraction), we can get 24 as:
41 / 1.75 = 23. 857 which is close to 24.
However, since we need exact 24 and we restricted to using simple operations with the numbers given, let's consider another approach directly applying the numbers we have.
88 - 67 - 26 + 29 = 24
This is just a rearrangement such that one of the operations results in 24.
</think>
<answer> 88 - 67 - 26 + 29 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider what we need to do to get 73 with the numbers 17, 40, and 50. Since we only have three numbers and we need to achieve 73, it's most likely that subtraction and addition will be involved.
Now, 50 - 17 is 33, which is closer to 73.
Next, if we add the next number, 40 to 33, we are very close to 73 (73 = 33 + 40).
Thus, 50 - 17 + 40 does equal 73.
</think>
<answer> 50 - 17 + 40 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to combine the given numbers 78, 24, 15, and 28 using basic arithmetic operations to get 59. Let's look at the numbers we have.
- 78 is a relatively large number.
- 15 is a mid-sized number.
- 24 and 28 are close together and relatively small.
Considering addition and subtraction could quickly exceed our desired result or leave us short, let's explore multiplication and division.
Multiplying 78 by 28 gives 2184, which is far too large. Multiplying 78 by 24 gives 1872, still too large.
Dividing 78 by 15 gives 5.2, and dividing 28 by 24 gives 1.1666, neither are close to 59.
Adding 78 and 24 gives 102, not close to 59.
Subtracting 15 from 78 gives 63, subtracting 28 from 63 gives 35, and adding 24 gives 59.
So, the equation seems to be: 78 - 15 - 28 + 24 = 59.
</think>
<answer> 78 - 15 - 28 + 24 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's see what we can do to create 74 using the numbers 54, 31, and 11. We have basic arithmetic operations available to us. 
Multiplying 54 by 2 would give us 108, which is close to 74. Unfortunately, 54 doesn't divide by 2 evenly, so that won't work. 
Adding 31 and 11 gives us 42. If we could add more to get close to 74, we'd need 32 more. Unfortunately, 54 - 31 = 23 doesn't help.
Adding 31 to 11 also isn't the right amount. Let's try subtracting 31 from 54, which gives us 23. Now, to reach 74, we need 51 more. Subtracting 11 from 31 gives us 20. Thus, we would calculate 23 + 20 = 43, and adding 31 to this makes 74.
So, the equation with the available numbers would be 31 + (54 - 11). </think>
<answer> 31 + (54 - 11) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the equation to reach 61 using the numbers 90, 29, and 58. 
- If we start by considering larger numbers like 90 and 58, subtracting 58 from 90 gives 32.
- Now, we need an additional 29 to get to 61. We can see that 32 + 29 equals 61.
- Using the numbers 90, 29, and 58, we can use: (90 - 58) + 29 = 61.
</think>
<answer> (90 - 58) + 29 </answer>

==============
<think> To achieve a result of 88 using the numbers 53, 55, and 86 with basic arithmetic operations, we need to consider how we can manipulate these numbers using +, -, *, and /. 
First, note that 86 is quite close to 88, so subtracting 86 from 88 would be a quick way to get 2. Then we would need to add 53 and 55 to get 110 - 86 = 24 + 53 + 55 = 88.
So, let's use these numbers like this:
88 = 86 + 2
Now, we need to find 2. From the numbers 53 and 55, we can subtract 53 from 55 to get 2.
Hence, we have:
88 = 86 + (55 - 53)
</think>
<answer> 86 + (55 - 53) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 22, 53, 35, and 93 exactly once, resulting in 53. 
First, let's look at 53 itself. 
The easiest way to create 53 might be to subtract 22 from 75, but 75 isn't in the list. 
Then, consider multiplication and addition/subtraction. 
If we can form 75 using the given numbers, that will work. 
Notice that 22 + 35 + 93 does not equal 75. 
Then, consider if we can use division. 
35 * 2 = 70 is close to 75, so subtract 2. 
This gives: (35 * 2) - 2 = 70 - 2 = 68. 
To get from 68 to 75, we could add 7. 
But 7 is not given. 
The best option left after thorough examination is to use 22 + 35 - 93 since it is equivalent to 75 - 22 
This gives: (22 + 35) - 93 = 57 - 93 = -36, 
which is not 53. 
Therefore, let's check a different possible path. We can substitute and try: We are missing a way to get a value that when used in basic arithmetic will very easily solve the problem from 53.
It looks simpler to directly manipulate the numbers:
Using 35 + (93 - 22) = 35 + 71 = 106 - 53 = 53.
</think>
<answer> (35 + 93 - 22) - 53 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 91 using the numbers 67, 98, and 74 exactly once, with each used in one part of the equation. We can try different combinations of the arithmetic operations.
First, let's look at the target number, 91, and the numbers we have: 67, 98, 74.
- If we subtract 67 from 98, we get 31, which is closer to 91, but then we would need to get 60 from 74, which will not be possible using just one operation.
- If we subtract 74 from 98, we get 24, which is not helpful.
- Thus, let’s try adding 67 and 24 (which equals 91), and we already have 98 and 74 but can only use them once each. So we need to express 24 using the remaining numbers fitting our constraints.
- We can approach by trying to express 24 using other operations. Breaking it down, 24 = 98 - 74.
- Then we have:
  98 - 74 + 67 = 91
So our final equation is 98 - 74 + 67 = 91.
</think>
<answer> 98 - 74 + 67 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 82, 44, and 10 to make 28. 
First, note that 82 and 44 are much larger than 28, so we can't use them directly.
If we take a closer look at the operations, since 10 is relatively small, trying to subtract 10 from 44 or 82 doesn't seem like it will yield a number close to 28.
Let's try subtracting 10 from 44 first: 44 - 10 = 34.
Now we have 34 and 82. If we subtract 34 from 82 we get: 82 - 34 = 48.
This is still not 28, so let's try a different approach.
What if we consider dividing 82 by 10: 82 / 10 = 8.2, which isn't an integer and doesn't help much.
Instead, let's try subtracting 44 from 82: 82 - 44 = 38.
Now we have 38 and 10. If we subtract 10 from 38, we get: 38 - 10 = 28.
We have arrived at a number that equals our target. Therefore, the equation is 82 - 44 - 10 = 28.
</think>
<answer> 82 - 44 - 10 </answer>

<think> First, let's examine the numbers: 25, 16, and 88. One number that seems to stand out is 88, as the target number (79) is close to it. To get to 79 from 88, we need to subtract 9. We can find 9 easily using the other two numbers - if we take 16 - 25 we get -9, but we need +9 to reach 79 from 88.
Now, we have 88 - (16 - 25) = 88 - (-9) = 88 + 9 = 97. This is very close to our target, but we need to adjust it down to 79.
Let's check the operations we used - we have addition and subtraction. Since adding 8 can bring us closer to 79 from 97, let's try 88 + 16 - 25.
</think>
<answer> 88 + 16 - 25 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation using the numbers 76, 5, and 20 that equals 61, I'll start by considering what basic operations I can use with these numbers. One possibility is to subtract one number from the sum of the other two, as this often leads to results close to the target value. Let's try adding 76 and 20 first, which equals 96, then subtracting 5. So, the equation would be: (76 + 20) - 5 = 96 - 5 = 91. This is close to 61 but over the target. If I try subtracting smaller numbers, or using a different combination of operations, I might get closer. Let's consider: (76 - 20) + 5. This simplifies to 56 + 5, which equals 61 exactly. </think>
<answer> (76 - 20) + 5 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to identify how I can reach the number 78 using the numbers 64, 2, and 25. One way to approach this is to look for a combination that gets close to 78 and then modify it slightly.
Starting with the number 25, adding 2 results in 27. Now if I add 51 to 27, we would reach 78. The number 51 could be obtained by 64 minus 13. Breaking down 13, we can find that 25 minus 12 equals 13.
Therefore, combining all these steps, the equation can be written as (64 - 25) + 2 + (64 - 12). However, note that the problem specifies that the number 12 should not be used.
Checking for the best possible solution, we notice we could take 64 - 25 = 39, then multiply 39 by 2 which gives 78.
So, the equation ends up being: (64 - 25) * 2 = 78.
</think>
<answer> (64 - 25) * 2 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the basic arithmetic operations and how they might combine with the numbers 10, 44, and 60 to give us 38. Given that 44 is a bit bigger and 60 is quite big, we might need to subtract or divide to get closer to 38.
- If we subtract 10 from 44, we get 34, which is not close to 38.
- If we subtract 60 from 44, we get -16, which is not helpful.
So, let's try dividing 44 by 60.
- 44 divided by 60 gives approximately 0.7333. This is far from 38.
Next, let's try combining these in another way. Since 60 is the largest, we can subtract it from 44 and then use the result along with 10. By doing 44 - 60, we get -16, which again isn't useful.
Alternatively, we could consider multiplying or adding the numbers in a different way. If we take 10 and multiply it by 60, we get 600, which is too big. If we add 10 to 60, we get 70, which is also not useful.
However, if we look at 44 - (60 / 10), we can use division first: 60 divided by 10 is 6. Then subtracting that from 44 gives us 44 - 6 = 38.
</think>
<answer> 44 - (60 / 10) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the given numbers: 50, 89, 61. We need to create an equation using these numbers once each to equal 78. 
Let's calculate the difference between 89 and 61, which is 28.
Now we have two numbers left to use: 50 and 28. 
The next logical step is to see if we can manipulate these numbers to reach 78. 
50 + 28 is 78.
So, we've used 50 and 28 to reach 78. Since 28 is derived from 89 - 61, we can rewrite our equation as 50 + (89 - 61) = 78.
</think>
<answer> 50 + (89 - 61) </answer>

==============
<think> I have three numbers: 68, 80, and 56. The target number is 92. I need to use each number exactly once and perform basic arithmetic operations to reach the target. 
First, I'll try to combine these numbers in a way that might get me closer to 92. A good starting point is to look at the difference between 80 and 56, since this could help adjust the total to 92. 
80 - 56 = 24. 
Now, we need to add 68 to it to reach 92. 
24 + 68 = 92. 
This gives me an equation: 80 - 56 + 68 = 92.
</think>
<answer> (80 - 56) + 68 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll start by looking at the target number 94 and the numbers we have: 43, 12, 39. 
To get close to 94, let's try combining 43 and 39 first, as they are close to 92. 
(43 + 39 = 82)
Now, we need 12 more to reach 94. We have 12 left, so adding it will get us there directly:
82 + 12 = 94
Thus, the equation is: (43 + 39) + 12 = 94.
</think>
<answer>(43 + 39) + 12</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 67 using the numbers 56, 40, and 29. I should start by considering which number is closest to 67 to simplify the equation. 56 is the closest number, so I can subtract 56 from 67. This gives me 11 (67 - 56 = 11). Next, I need to balance this equation using the remaining numbers, 40 and 29. Adding 40 and subtracting 29 will give me 11 (40 - 29 = 11). Therefore, I can add 40 to 56 and then subtract 29 to reach 67. 
So, the equation is 56 + 40 - 29 = 67.
</think>
<answer> 56 + 40 - 29 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 66 using the numbers 98, 58, and 26 exactly once. 
Considering the numbers given, 98 seems like an outlier for this sum, so let's try rearranging the operations and numbers.
We can try subtracting 58 from 98 first: 98 - 58 = 40.
Now we need to get from 40 to 66 using 26. The best way to do this is to add 26 to 40: 40 + 26 = 66.
So, the equation is: 98 - 58 + 26 = 66.
</think>
<answer> 98 - 58 + 26 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's evaluate the given numbers [19, 14, 21]. Looking at these numbers, one thing we can do is try subtracting 14 from 21 and then adding 19 to see if it equals 26.
1. 21 - 14 = 7
2. Then, 7 + 19 = 26
This equals 26, so we have found a way to create an equation using all the numbers.
</think>
<answer> (21 - 14) + 19 </answer>

==============
<think> The goal is to create an equation using the numbers 9, 17, and 62 that equals 70. 
We can start by looking at the target number and the values we have. Notice that 62 is quite close to 70, so let's consider subtracting or adding smaller numbers to reach 70.
If we subtract 9 from 62, we get 53. Now we need 17 more to reach 70. Clearly, 17 is equal to 17, so we can easily reach our target.
Therefore, the equation can be: 62 - 9 + 17 = 70.
</think>
<answer> 62 - 9 + 17 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's examine the numbers we have: 6, 8, and 36. We need to use each number exactly once to make an equation that equals 50.
It looks like 36 is a good starting point since it's close to 50. We can consider using either subtraction or division with 36.
If we subtract 36 from 50, we get 14. But we have to use 6 and 8 left also. If we add 6 and 8 together, we get 14, which matches.
So, one way to make 50 using the numbers and operations is: 50 = 36 + 6 + 8
</think>
<answer> 36 + 6 + 8 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider how we could use the numbers 48, 85, and 40 to equal 77. We can start by looking at the numbers we have available.
85 and 40 look like they might be close to 77, so let's consider adding or subtracting 48 to/from either of those numbers. If we subtract 48 from 85, we get 37. If we add 40 and 37, we get 77. 
Now, let's put this together: Subtract 48 from 85, add the result to 40, and we get:
85 - 48 + 40 = 77
</think>
<answer> 85 - 48 + 40 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll identify that we have to use each number [5, 34, 57, 98] exactly once to get 12. Let's consider the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
We know that 98 and 57 are close enough that subtracting them will give us a number close to 40 that we can manipulate with the remaining numbers to get to 12.
98 - 57 = 41
Now, we need to find a way to make 41 - 29 = 12 because 12 is the required result.
The numbers that we have left are 5 and 34. 34 - 5 = 29.
Thus, the equation is: 98 - 57 - (34 - 5) = 12.
</think>
<answer> 98 - 57 - (34 - 5) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers available: 35, 85, and 9. We need to get to 59 using basic arithmetic operations and each number only once.
We see that 85 - 35 = 50, which is close to 59. The difference between 50 and 59 is 9. 
Thus, we can form the equation: 50 + 9 = 59.
Since 85 - 35 = 50, we can directly add 9 to the result of this subtraction to get 59.
So the equation is: (85 - 35) + 9 = 59.
</think>
<answer>(85 - 35) + 9</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create a sum of 99 using the numbers 98, 81, and 80. I can try combining them using addition and subtraction.
98 + 81 = 179
Now, I need 80 less to reach 99, so let's subtract 80 from 179.
179 - 80 = 99
So we get the equation from combining operations: (98 + 81) - 80 = 99.
</think>
<answer> (98 + 81) - 80 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 49, 78, and 32 that equals 95. 
First, let's see how close we can get to 95 with just two of these numbers. If I add 49 and 78 I get 127, which is too much. Subtracting 49 from 78 gives me 29.
Now, 95 - 29 = 66, which is one of the numbers we have. So, I need to find a way to create 66 using 49 and 32. If I take 49 and add 17 to it, I get 66.
17 can be made from 78 - 32. Therefore, 49 + (78 - 32) = 95.
</think>
<answer> (49 + 78 - 32) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an expression that equals 42 using the numbers 20, 65, and 3. Let's start by looking at what we can do with the numbers we have.
We have the number 3 and 20, so 3 * 20 = 60. We are short by 6 but have 65 to work with.
Subtracting 3 from 65 gives us 62. This is closer but we need 6 less to get to 42.
By taking 65 and subtracting 20, 65 - 20 = 45. However, this is too much.
If I subtract 20 from 65, it gives me 45, and then I need -3 more to reach 42.
If I calculate 65 - 20 - 3, I get 42 (because 65 - 23 = 42).
So, the equation is 65 - 20 - 3 = 42.
</think>
<answer> 65 - 20 - 3 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 59, 58, 60, and 16. Our goal is to create an equation that equals 75 using each number exactly once.
I'll start by thinking about how we can get close to 75. Subtracting 16 from 60 gives me 44. Now I can subtract 58 from 59 to get 1. So 44 + 1 is 45, which is far from 75.
Let's try multiplying 59 and 58 - this gives 3422, which is too high. Similarly, 59 * 60 gives 3480, which is also too high.
How about 60 * 58 - 59? This gives 3401, still too high. On the other hand, 59 * 60 - 58 would give 3442, slightly less than 75.
Let's adjust 59 * 58 - 60. This calculation gives us 3442 - 60 = 3382, much too high.
58 * 60 - 59 would be 3471, too high.
Let's check 60 * 59 - 58. This is 3542, also too high. But what about 60 * 59 - 58 + 16? Breaking this down:
60 * 59 = 3540
Then subtracting 58 = 3482
Finally, adding 16 = 3500
This is quite close, but still not exactly 75.
Finally, let's verify 60 * 59 - 58 - 16. This yields 3540 - 58 - 16 = 3486 - 16 = 3470.
The closest we get with these manipulations comes when we use: 60 * 59 - 58 - 16 = 3470.
After all the trials, we find the correct combination is rather elusive, given the limited options. Let's revisit the simpler arithmetic like addition and subtraction: 59 + 58 + 16 = 133, and removing numbers from 133 or adding other combinations gets us closer to 75.
Finally, 60 + 58 + 16 = 134, and 134 - 59 = 75.
</think>
<answer> 60 + 58 + 16 - 59 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 46, 72, and 52. Our goal is to create an equation that results in 66, using each of these numbers only once.
Let's start by looking at 72 and 52. Notice that if we divide 72 by 52, we get a quotient of about 1.3846. This is close to 1, which is our remaining value (66 - 46 = 20), so let's explore further.
Now, if we multiply the quotient 1.3846 by 20, we get approximately 27.692, which is very close to 28. But since we can only use whole numbers, this approach might not be accurate enough.
Instead, let's try to manipulate the numbers differently. We can try adding or subtracting numbers to see if we can get closer to 66.
If we take 46 and subtract 52, we get -6. Adding 72 to this result gives us 66. This seems like a perfect match! We haven't used all the numbers yet, and -6 + 72 = 66. Thus, the numbers 46, 52, and 72 can form the equation 72 - 52 + 46 = 66.
</think>
<answer> 72 - 52 + 46 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to get close to 67 using the numbers 19, 27, and 21. Adding all of them gives us 67, although we can't use division or multiplication as they would reduce the sum. If we try taking away 19 from 67, we get 48. Now, 27 + 21 equals 48. This is very close, but we need to add more to get to 67. The difference between 48 and 67 is 19. Hence, adding 19 to 48 will give us 67.
</think>
<answer> 27 + 21 + 19 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 98 using the numbers 31, 21, and 46. I'll start by checking if any of the numbers can be used in a straightforward way to reach 98.
Combining 46 and 52 gives me 98, but I don't have a 52 directly. If I subtract 46 from 98, I get 52, which means I need to subtract 46 from 98.
Next, I see that 98 - 46 = 52. I need 52 in terms of the other numbers. If I add 21 to 31, I get 52.
So we have this equation: 98 = 46 + (31 + 21).
</think>
<answer> (46 + (31 + 21)) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 31, 21, and 46. We need to create an equation that results in 98. 
We should first try summing and subtracting the numbers to get as close to 98 as possible:
31 + 21 + 46 = 98
This gives us the exact number we need. Therefore, the equation we seek is simply the sum of the three numbers.
</think>
<answer> 31 + 21 + 46 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers given: 4, 34, and 4. We need to arrange these to make 34 using basic arithmetic operations. One way to approach this is to look at if 34 minus any of the numbers or a combination of the numbers could result in 34.
- If we try 34 - 4 = 30, it's close but we need 34, not 30.
- Next, let's consider 34 + 4 = 38, which is too high.
- We think about using multiplication and division, but applying division 34 / 4 would give 8.5, which isn't an integer and doesn't fit since we need whole numbers.
- Now, let's look at multiplication and addition: 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 34.
- Finally, we could combine numbers in a way that uses multiplication and subtraction or addition. 34 = 4 + 4 + 26, but 26 is not a product of the numbers.
Given the constraint that each number can be used only once and only using basic arithmetic operations, we find one combination.
4 + (34 - 4) = 4 + 30 = 34.
</think>
<answer> 4 + (34 - 4) </answer>

==============
<think> I have the numbers 25, 24, and 83 to make 34 using basic arithmetic operations. Let's start by considering subtraction and addition as they can quickly reduce or increase numbers from what we need. 
- 83 - 25 = 58 (too big)
- 83 - 24 = 59 (closer, but still too big)
- 83 - 24 - 25 = 34 (this works)
- So the equation can be (83 - 24 - 25) = 34.
  Alternatively, I could consider combining numbers first.
- 25 - 24 = 1 (this is too small)
- 24 + 25 = 49 (this seems further from 34)
So the solution using subtraction and putting the numbers in a specific order works better: 83 - 24 - 25.
</think>
<answer> (83 - 24 - 25) </answer>

==============
<think> To get 82 using the numbers 15, 90, and 7 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations, let's consider possible operations and combinations:
One approach could be to try multiplication, then subtraction and addition.
We want:
(90 * x) + y = 82
We know 90 is quite large and doesn't seem to fit well as a base for the target, so let's try:
90 - 15 = 75
Now we need to reach 82, so:
75 + y = 82
This means:
y = 7
Since 90 - 15 + 7 = 82, all the numbers are used exactly once and the target is achieved.
</think>
<answer> 90 - 15 + 7 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's analyze the numbers given: [15, 67, 75, 16]. We need to form an equation with these numbers using basic arithmetic operations, where each number is used only once and the result should be 23.
We can start by considering the operations and possible combinations:
- Multiplication and division could potentially change the value disproportionately.
- Addition and subtraction could be more manageable.
The number 75 is the largest and could be useful in forming a larger number. The number 15 is also useful because 15 * 1 = 15, and 15 + 16 = 31, which seems close but still too high. The smallest numbers, 15 and 16, need to be combined in a way that allows subtraction or addition to get us to 23.
75 - 16 = 59, which is too large. If we consider 75 - 67, we get 8. Then if we add 15 and 16 in some way, we should aim for 23. 
15 + 16 = 31, which is close but higher. If we adjust this, perhaps 67 - 15 = 52 and then 52 - 16 = 36, then 36 - 15 = 21, and we need 2 more to hit 23, which suggests 23 = 36 - 15 - (67 - 16).
However, the simpler and more logical way to get to 23 using basic operations on the given numbers is:
15 + 67 - 75 + 16 = 23. This follows as:
1. 15 + 67 = 82
2. 82 - 75 = 7
3. 7 + 16 = 23
</think>
<answer> (15 + 67 - 75 + 16) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers available: 77, 69, and 59. We need to combine these using basic arithmetic operations so that we end up with 87.
One way to approach this could be trying to subtract and add the numbers in different combinations to reach the target.
If we subtract 59 from 77, we get 18. Then, we need 69 more to reach 87 (18 + 69 = 87).
So, we have 77 - 59 = 18, and 18 + 69 = 87.
This gives us the equation: (77 - 59) + 69 = 87.
</think>
<answer> (77 - 59) + 69 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to find a way to use the numbers 6, 9, and 43 only once to make an equation that equals 40. The arithmetic operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I'll start by considering the larger number, 43, as a possible component. Maybe subtracting or dividing will bring me closer to 40. However, given 43, it's better to subtract it or divide by something smaller. Next, I see that 9 is relatively easy to work with. Adding or subtracting 9 could bring us closer to 40. So, let's consider the possibility of subtracting or adding 9 to or from 43, and then performing other operations with 6 to reach 40. If I subtract 9 from 43, I get 34. Now I need an operation with 6 to get from 34 to 40. Adding 6 to 34 gives me exactly 40. Thus, the equation should be: 43 - 9 + 6 = 40. </think>
<answer> 43 - 9 + 6 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use the numbers 64, 96, and 58 to get 26. One approach is to consider how I can subtract or add a number to or from another to get close to 26.
One number stands out, 58, as it is quite close to 26. So, I will first subtract 58 from 64 and 96. 
Doing the calculations:
64 - 58 = 6
96 - 58 = 38
Now, I need to get 26 using the results 6 and 38. 
I can get this by subtracting 12 from 38. But I need to find where 12 comes from.
I can obtain 12 by subtracting 58 from 64, which gives me 6 as I've already calculated.
This way, I can now write the equation as:
(64 - 58) - (96 - 64) = 6 - 38 = -32, which is not 26.
However, if I try to reverse the direction of the second part to achieve 12 first, then use 12 to get 26:
96 - 64 - (58 - 32) = 32 - 26 = 6, which is closer but not quite right.
Since the direct approach is a bit tangled, I should try another:
(96 - 64) - (58 - (64-96)) = 32 - 46 = -14, which is not 26.
The above attempts did not work as intended. Let me simplify the calculation by directly figuring out:
Using 64 - (96 - 58), this results in 64 - 38 = 26.
</think>
<answer> 64 - (96 - 58) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a combination of the numbers 7, 37, 54, and 58 that, when combined using basic arithmetic operations, results in 34. 
- Multiplying 7 and 58 gives me 406, which is far from 34.
- Adding or subtracting the numbers from each other also doesn't seem to be leading me towards 34.
- Dividing 58 by 17 doesn't work because 17 is not among the given numbers.
Now let's consider combining numbers and operations: if I take 58 - 54 = 4 and then divide by 7, I get 4 / 7 ≈ 0.571, which is still not 34.
Next, if I take (37 - 58) + 7 = -13 + 7 = -6 which is also not correct.
But now if I look again, notice that (54 - 37) = 17 and then dividing 17 by 7 = 2.429, which is still not 34.
Then, I might consider dividing 37 by 7 and then adding 58 - 37 = 21. This gives (37 / 7) + 21 ≈ 5.29 + 21 ≈ 26.29, still not 34.
However, I arrive at (37 - 58) / 7 + 54 = -21 / 7 + 54 = -3 + 54 = 51 which is still not 34.
Then I recall checking 37 + 54 = 91, 58 - 54 = 4, and realize 37 + 4 = 41 - 7 = 34.
So, the equation I'm thinking of is: 37 + (58 - 54) - 7 = 34.

<answer> 37 + (58 - 54) - 7 </answer>

==============
<think> To get to 28 using the numbers 4, 92, and 68 only once, let's consider the operations we have available: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
One way to approach this is to consider division and addition/multiplication. Let's try to divide one of the numbers by another and then add/multiply the results or the remaining number.
Looking at 92, it seems quite large and 4 is very small. The straightforward division 92/4 doesn't give us easily manageable intermediate results. However, 92 - 68 = 24. Now we need 28 which is 24 + 4. Thus, we can formulate the equation using these steps:
24 + 4 can be achieved by (92 - 68) + 4.
</think>
<answer> ((92 - 68) + 4) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 81, 1, and 28 to equal 54. Let's start by considering possible operations.
- Multiplying 81 by 1 gives us 81.
- Dividing 81 by 1 gives us 81.
- Subtracting 28 from 81 gives us 53.
- Adding 1 to 53 would make it 54.
However, since we can only use each number once, and we need to get to 54, using addition of 1 to 53 is not possible. So, let's try multiplications and divisions.
- Multiplying 1 by 28 gives us 28.
- Dividing 81 by 28 gives us a decimal, which we might not want.
Considering the integers we have, the most logical step would be to subtract 28 from 81 to get 53, and then add 1 to get 54.
53 + 1 = 54.
Therefore, the equation will be 81 - 28 + 1 = 54.
</think>
<answer> 81 - 28 + 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider what operations we can use and what we can create with the numbers given: 81, 1, and 28. We need to reach a result of 54 using each number exactly once.
If we look at 81 and 28, we might consider using subtraction and division. Let's try to subtract 28 from 81 first:
81 - 28 = 53
This leaves us with 53, and we still need to use 1 to reach 54. If we divide 53 by 1, we get 53. But this didn't work. 
Next, let's consider multiplying the result of subtracting 28 from 81 by 1. Multiplying any number by 1 keeps the number the same, so:
53 * 1 = 53
This is still not 54. 
Let's then think about adding 1 to 53 instead:
53 + 1 = 54
This gives us the number we need (54) with all the numbers used exactly once. So, the equation should be:
(81 - 28) + 1 = 54
</think>
<answer>(81 - 28) + 1</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers 87, 3, and 68. We need to create an equation that equals 16 using these numbers only once. 
Since 68 is the largest number, let's consider using it in the subtraction or division. However, subtracting 68 from 87 to get a one-digit result might not be straightforward.
Taking 3 away from 87 gives us 84. Now, dividing 84 by 68 would give us a decimal number which is not 16.
Let's consider the other possibilities - multiplication and subtraction. If we multiply 3 by 68, we get 204, which is too large.
The only remaining operation is subtraction, and we need a way to balance it out. Since 87 - 68 = 19, which is close to 16, we can try to adjust this by using 3.
If we take 3 from 19, we have 16, which matches our target. Therefore, the equation is (87 - 68) - 3 = 16.
</think>
<answer> (87 - 68) - 3 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 70, 83, and 68. We need to combine these using the basic arithmetic operations to get 55. 
- If we tried division, it would result in a fractional number, and using the result of that division with the other numbers would likely not yield 55.
- If we add or subtract these numbers directly, we see that 68 + 70 = 138 which is too high, and 68 - 70 = -2 which is too low to be 55.
- Considering multiplication or a combination of operations, we notice that 83 - 68 = 15, which is useful but still far from 55.
- Then, let's try 70 - 15 = 55, which is exactly what we want. We need to create 15 using 83 and 68.
- We realize 83 - 68 equals 15. Now we can combine 70 - (83 - 68) = 55.
</think>
<answer> 70 - (83 - 68) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I should consider the goal which is to achieve 55 using the numbers 70, 83, and 68 exactly once. I see an opportunity to manipulate these numbers by subtraction or by dividing one of them.
Let's start with the subtraction method. If I subtract 70 from 83, I get 13. Now I have to add 68 to 13 which also gives me 81. This isn't 55, so let's try other combinations.
Next, I'll think about division. If I divide 83 by 68, I get 1.2137 (approximately). To get close to 55, I'd need some number multiplied by 1.2137. The number 70 is too large, so I'll try dividing 70 by 68 to get approximately 1.039 (again, approximate). Now to get 55, I'd need 53.38, which is close but not exactly 55.
This doesn't seem to work either. Since successful direct calculations didn't yield 55, I recall another approach - combining operations. If I first compute 83 - 68 = 15, then add 70 to that result, I get 15 + 70 = 85, which is too large.
Next, let's consider another approach where I subtract 68 from 70 and then add that result to 83. This would give me (70 - 68) + 83 = 2 + 83 = 85, which is still too large.
Finally, let's try: If I calculate (83 - 70) + 68, it equals 13 + 68 which is 81. This didn't lead us to 55. I see I've tried several combinations but none worked so I realize I need a different path.
Upon review, a successful combination arises when I recognize I can achieve the goal with a different set of operations. The critical observation here is to use 83 minus 68 equals 15, and then add 70 to it giving 15 + 70 = 85.
In fact, realizing 55 is the sum 85 - 30, and 30 is 70 - 40 where 40 = 83 - 68, this isn't straightforward enough. I realize I made a mistake in my sequence. The correct approach operating as intended finds 68 subtracted from 70 usually gives me 9, and 9 + 83 remains far from 55. 
I'll revisit direct simple operations: 70 - 68 = 2 and then 2 + 83 yields 85 (we're still far).
Another misstep. The correct route is to achieve the goal where we realize 55 is nearly (70 + 83 - 12), but I see mistake here's 12 is not (83 - 70) often repeated.
Carefully rechecking I find combination works as 70 - (83 - 68) = 70 - 15 = 55.
</think>
<answer> 70 - (83 - 68) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's analyze the numbers we have: 70, 83, and 68. The target is 55.
The target number is closer to 68 than to 70 or 83, so we might think of subtracting or adding a small number to 68.
Calculating 68 - 13 should give us our target number 55. 
Since 13 = 83 - 70, we can replace 13 with (83 - 70).
So, the equation will be 68 - (83 - 70) = 55.
</think>
<answer> 68 - (83 - 70) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 3, 69, and 37. We need to create an equation that equals 35 using each number exactly once.
One observation is that 69 - 37 = 32. This gives us a clue that we can tweak this result to get 35. Since we already have 32, we need to add 3 to reach 35. The number 3 is already in our set of numbers.
So, using the operation:
69 - 37 + 3 = 35
</think>
<answer> (69 - 37) + 3 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 90, 9, and 15. We need to use each of these numbers exactly once to create an equation that results in 54.
One way to approach this is to start with one of the numbers and then use arithmetic operations to reduce it down to 54.
If I divide 90 by 15, I get 6. Now I need to get from 6 to 54 using only 9 (since we can't use 90 or 15 again). 
To get from 6 to 54, I need to multiply by 9.
So, the equation would be (90 / 15) * 9.
Let's check if this gives us 54.
(90 / 15) * 9 = 6 * 9 = 54.
This satisfies the requirement. </think>
<answer>(90 / 15) * 9</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll examine the numbers given: [95, 45, 33]. One interesting observation is that 95 - 45 = 50. Now, if we need to make 83, we can add 33 to 50. So, 50 + 33 = 83. But, we only have 33 once. We can use the 50 from the subtraction of 95 and 45 to achieve our goal. The equation would be 95 - 45 + 33, which equals 83.
</think>
<answer> 95 - 45 + 33 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to use the numbers 95, 45, and 33, each only once, to make 83.
Let's start by looking at the larger numbers 95 and 45. If we subtract the smaller number (33) from 95, we get:
95 - 33 = 62
Now we have 62 and 45. We need one more step to get to 83. If we subtract 45 from 62, we get:
62 - 45 = 17
But we need to reach 83, so this combination isn't quite right.
Let's try another approach. We can add 45 and 33 to get 78, and then we need to add 5 to get 83. We can get 78 by subtracting 95 by 17. Unfortunately, 17 cannot be formed using 95, 45, and 33 with basic arithmetic.
Since we can only move and use each number once, it seems no basic arithmetic operation will allow us to reach 83 directly using these numbers. So, it may be that no combination can be formed to get 83 with the given set of numbers.
</think>
<answer> 95 - 45 + 33 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll assess the numbers we have: 57, 60, and 82. I want to get to 79 using basic arithmetic operations.
I see that 82 - 60 = 22. Now I need to get 57 - 22 = 35 but I'm close. 35 is not 79, so I try another approach.
57 + 22 = 79, which is exactly what I need. The numbers 60 and 82 are already used in this equation.
So the equation is 57 + (82 - 60).
</think>
<answer> 57 + (82 - 60) </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to consider how the numbers 20, 22, and 92 can be manipulated using basic arithmetic operations to equal 50. 
- A straightforward way to start is to look if any of these numbers can be combined to get something close to 50.
- Let's try 22 + 28. But 28 is not a number given. 
- Let's try 20 + 30. Again, we need another number to get to 50, but 30 isn't one of our numbers.
- Now, recall 92. We can subtract 92 - 42 which gives us 50. Here, 42 can be derived by 22 + 20.
- So, 92 - (22 + 20) = 92 - 42 = 50.
</think>
<answer> 92 - (22 + 20) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 72, 35, and 45 exactly once, which should equal 62. 
I'll evaluate combinations of these numbers with basic arithmetic operations.
- If I add them together: 72 + 35 + 45 = 152, which is too high.
- If I subtract, I get: 72 - 35 - 45 = -18, which is too low.
- If I multiply, it doesn't seem helpful as 72 * 35 * 45 is a very large number.
- If I divide, I shouldn't get a whole number for such large inputs. 
Considering the structure of the problem, let's try to subtract the smallest number from the sum of the other two numbers:
72 + 35 = 107
107 - 45 = 62
This gives the correct result of 62. 
So, the equation is: 72 + 35 - 45 = 62.
</think>
<answer> 72 + 35 - 45 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's assess the numbers available: 37, 75, 75. We need to create an equation that equals 38 using each number exactly once, with the allowed operations being addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- The difference between 75 and 37 is 38 (75 - 37 = 38), but this uses all three numbers, which is not allowed.
- One way to proceed would be to divide 75 by 75, which equals 1, and then subtract 37 from this result. That would give us 1 - 37 = -36, which is not 38.
- However, if we rearrange our thought process, we realize that we could subtract the smaller number from the larger one to get 75 - 37 = 38. But since we can't use the same number twice in our equation, this approach fails.
- Another possibility is to divide and add - divide 75 by 75 which gives us 1, and then add 37 to this - (75 / 75) + 37 = 1 + 37 = 38.
</think>
<answer> (75 / 75) + 37 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to make the sum or difference equal 68 using the given numbers 97, 49, and 78. Looking at these, if I remove 78 from 97, I get 19. Now, I need to adjust this 19 to make the whole equation equal 68. If I subtract 49 from 19, I get -30, which isn't helpful in forming our desired result. Instead, I'll try adding 19 and 49. This gives me 68, which is exactly what I need. Therefore, the equation would be 97 - 78 + 49 = 68. </think>
<answer> 97 - 78 + 49 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the target number we need to achieve: 77. We're given three numbers: 47, 17, and 13. One effective way to solve this is by looking for a way to make use of the difference and the sum of two of these numbers.
- If we consider 47 and 13, their difference is 47 - 13 = 34. Now, if we add 17 to this, we get 34 + 17 = 51, which is not what we want.
- Instead, let's try 47 - 13 = 34 and then see how adding 17 to this helps us get closer to 77. Adding 17 to 34 gives us 51, and to get to 77, we need to add another 26. However, we don't have 26 directly, but we can achieve this by rearranging numbers.
A better approach seems to be using 47 - (17 + 13) which equals 47 - 30 = 17. Then adding 60 might bring us closer to 77. But we can see that 47 - (17 + 13) + 60 would give more complexity than we need.
Looking back thoroughly at the numbers and calculations, let's simplify and recognize that 47 + 17 + 13 = 77 directly, since all three numbers are needed here.
</think>
<answer> 47 + 17 + 13 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 98, 38, and 14 that equals 74. I should start by trying to use addition or subtraction since these directly provide a simple result.
Let's try to use numbers as coefficients for another operation.
Looking at the numbers, 98 seems too large to be reduced just by subtraction or division with 38 or 14 to reach 74. Dividing 98 by 14 gives 7 with a remainder.
So, let's use the division of 98 by 14 first to get 7. Then we need to add the 38 to reach 74.
(98 / 14) + 38 = 7 + 38 = 45 (This is not 74)
This doesn't work as is. Let's try recombining it: If we subtract 38 from 98 first, we get 60. Now we need to add 14 to reach 74.
So, the correct equation would be: 98 - 38 + 14 = 60 + 14 = 74
</think>
<answer> (98 - 38) + 14 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use the numbers 7, 63, and 5 to make 61. A good place to start might be trying to form 61 using subtraction or addition since the target is very close to one of the given numbers.
- If I use 63 and 5, I get 63 - 5 = 58. Now I need 3 more to reach 61.
- 7 is the only other number available, and 58 + 7 = 65, which is not 61.
- What if I try 63 - 7? That gives me 56, still short of 61.
- Now, how about 63 + 5 - 7? This simplifies to 63 + 5 - 7 = 63 + 5 - 7 = 58 + 7 = 65, which also doesn't work.
- Finally, let me consider 63 - 5 + 7. This means 63 - 5 = 58, and then adding 7 gives 58 + 7 = 65, which is still not 61.
- Considering 58 is too high and the number 5 too low, I realize I should check another order of operations carefully.
- After reviewing again, I notice that 63 - 7 + 5 = 58 + 5 = 63 + 5 - 7 = 61. 
- Therefore, the correct equation is 63 - 7 + 5.
</think>
<answer>63 - 7 + 5</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list out the numbers we have: 72, 14, and 71. We need to create an equation that sums up to 15 using these numbers exactly once.
Looking at the numbers, we can quickly recognize a simple relationship:
71 - 14 = 57
57 - 72 = -15
This means we have the combination of numbers that equals -15. To get 15, we just need to negate this result. Since we cannot use any operators to negate this directly, we need to consider a different approach.
If we look at the components 72 and 14, we can try subtraction and see if we can form 15. Indeed:
72 - 14 = 58
If we use 71, then:
71 - 58 = 13
And if we subtract this result from our target of 15:
15 - 13 = 2
But we need to reconsider our approach. Instead of trying to build 15 directly, we can look at the equation:
(72 - (71 - 14)) = 15
This equation satisfies the requirement to use each number exactly once and results in 15 when evaluated.
</think>
<answer> (72 - (71 - 14)) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 6, 51, 33, and 13. We need to use these exactly once to get the result of 77. One useful approach is to start with the largest numbers and see if we can manipulate them to reach 77.

If we look at 51, that's close to 77. If we can subtract or add something to or from 51, we might hit the number 77. If not, we might need to use other numbers in combination.

Here, we notice that if we subtract 13 from 51, we get 38. Now, we need an extra 39 to get to 77. We have the number 33, which is part of our goal. If we take 33 from 38, we get -5, which isn't helping us get to 77 directly.

Now, since this subtraction didn't work, let's try adding the next largest number, 33, to the result of 51 - 13. If we add 33 to 38, we get 71, and adding 6 to 71 will give us 77. Thus, (51 - 13) + 33 + 6 = 77.
</think>
<answer> (51 - 13) + 33 + 6 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's examine the numbers we have: 99, 18, 11, 51. We need to use these numbers exactly once and combine them using basic arithmetic operations to get 77.
77 is close to 99, so we might try subtracting 22 from 99.
99 - 22 = 77
But 22 is not our available number. How about using other combinations?
18 + 51 = 69, which is still far from our target.
Let's consider using multiplication or division to get closer to 77.
99 * (18 - 11) = 99 * 7 = 693, way too high.
51 * 18 = 918, also too high.
18 * 11 = 198, still too far.
99 - 22 = 77 seems promising initially but we need to use all numbers.
What if we first subtract the largest number from 99:
99 - 51 = 48
Then use the remaining numbers to reach 39 (77 - 48):
48 + 18 = 66
So, 99 - 51 + 18 = 77
This uses all 99, 18, and 51. We're missing 11.
However, 11 * 7 = 77, but 7 is not in our set.
The correct combination utilizing all numbers:
99 - 51 + 18 + 11 - 7 equals 77. Since 7 is not in the set, it suggests an error.
Considering the straightforward application closest:
99 - 51 + 18 = 66, then adding 11:
66 + 11 = 77
Therefore, the equation becomes: 99 - 51 + 18 + 11 = 77. However, as the instruction limited to 3 numbers to reach 77, let's try another way using 99 - 51 + 18 + 3 (where 3 is deducted from 11):
99 - 51 + 18 - (11 - 3) = 66 - 8 = 58.
Instead, 99 - 51 + 11 = 59, so 99 - 51 + (11 + 6) = 85. It seems only two numbers (99 and 11) work:
99 - 11 + 51 - 22 = 77,
And 22 is still missing.
This hints 99 - 51 + 18 + 11 - 7 = 77 was incorrect as 7 should be 22:
99 - 51 + 18 + 11 - 11 + 11 = 77.
Thus multiple solutions arise. But closest valid should be:
99 - 51 + 18 + 11 = 77.
</think>
<answer> 99 - 51 + 18 + 11 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 99, 18, 11, and 51. We need to create an equation that equals 77 using each number exactly once.
- Adding the numbers 99 and 18 gives us 117.
- Subtracting 11 from 117 gives us 106.
- Subtracting 51 from 106 gives us 55.
This shows that we need to subtract some number from 117 to get 77. 
- 117 - 40 = 77.
Now, let's check if we can form 40 from the numbers 99, 18, 11, and 51.
- 99 - 51 = 48, but this doesn't help.
- If we rearrange or use combinations, the only way we can get to 40 is: 99 - 51 - 18 = 20, and then 20 + 11 = 31, and then 40.
- This means we need an additional 10 to get to 40 from 20, so we need to use the 18 and 11 in another way. We have 18 + 11 = 29, and we still need 10 more. We can create 10 from 51 - 41, but using a number greater than 51 won't work. So, the only correct step is to use 51 - 18 - 11 = 22, and then 22 - 2 = 20, and then 20 + 10 = 30, and then 30 + 10 = 40.
So, the equation should be: 99 - (51 - 18 - 11).
</think>
<answer> 99 - (51 - 18 - 11) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers and their potential combinations using the basic arithmetic operations. We need to reach a result of 41 using 78, 27, and 64, where each number is used exactly once.
One strategy is to explore multiplications and subtractions because larger numbers and close values to the target can often simplify the process.
- If we take 78 * 27, we get 2106, which is far too high.
- If we try 78 * 64, we get 4992, again too high.
- Considering division, 78 / 27 is approximately 2.9, which can’t be applied directly.
- Let's then try different combinations like 78 - 27 * 64 = 78 - 1728 = -1650, which is clearly not 41.
- Another option is 78 - 64 * 27. If we calculate this:
  - First, 64 * 27 = 1728.
  - Then, 78 - 1728 = -1650, which is not 41.
- Let's try 64 * 27 - 78. 
  - First, 64 * 27 = 1728.
  - Then, 1728 - 78 = 1650.
- Now, 78 - (64 * 27) gives:
  - This approach gives -1650 again.
- Let's try a different sequence: 78 - 64 + 27 which is:
  - 78 - 64 = 14
  - 14 + 27 = 41
</think>
<answer> 78 - 64 + 27 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll evaluate the numbers given: 85, 74, and 76. 
To get 87 as an answer, I should consider the operations and numbers available.
Considering basic arithmetic operations, I notice that 85 and 76 are close to 87. 
Let's add 76 to 7 to get 87.
76 + 7 = 87, but 7 is not one of the numbers given.
Now, 85 and 74 are left.
If I subtract 74 from 85, I get 11.
So, 76 + 11 = 87.
Finally, 11 comes from subtracting 74 from 85 (76 - 74 = 11).
Therefore, the equation is 76 + (85 - 74) = 87.

<answer> 76 + (85 - 74) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 29, 97, and 9. We need to use these numbers exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get a result of 59. 
- 97 is the largest number and could potentially help us reach the target number.
- 9 is smaller and could be used to subtract from 97 or add to 29.
- 29 and 97 themselves do not give us 59 either by addition or subtraction, but we can consider division.
Let's try 97 - 9 - 29 = 59. We need to check if this uses each number only once correctly and if arithmetic operations are valid.
97 - 9 - 29 does involve subtraction correctly three times, using each number exactly once.
</think>
<answer> 97 - 9 - 29 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to create an equation that equals 72 using the numbers 52, 31, and 51 exactly once. One way to approach this is by considering how we can manipulate these numbers with basic arithmetic operations.
We notice that 72 - 52 = 20.
Then we need 20 from 31 and 51. If we use the subtraction operation on 51 and 31, we get 51 - 31 = 20.
So, our equation becomes 72 = 52 + (51 - 31).
</think>
<answer> (52 + 51 - 31) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 72 using the numbers 52, 31, and 51 exactly once. One way to approach this is to see if combining two numbers through arithmetic will give me the third number required to make 72.
Looking at the numbers, I see that 52 + 20 would give me 72, but 20 isn't directly available. However, I can use 51 - 5. If I do 51 - 5 = 46, then I just need to add 26 to that to reach 72. Since 52 - 51 = 1, using this subtraction, I can then add 26, which is 52 + 11 but can be achieved by 52 - 51 and then adding 5 + 3. So the equation would be:
52 - 51 + (51 - 51 - 5 + 5 + 3). However, to match the criteria of using each number exactly once and having a simpler expression, I think about 52 + (51 - 31) = 52 + 20 = 72. This uses each number only once and satisfies the equation. </think>
<answer> 52 + (51 - 31) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 9, 51, and 38 that equals 22. While there are no direct combinations that will give us 22 when combining these three numbers with basic arithmetic operations, we can manipulate the numbers to get close or use one of them as a reference point. 
Since 51 is significantly larger than the target (22), subtracting 51 from 22 will not work. The difference is -29, which is not helpful here. 
Considering the 38, we can get closer to the target by subtracting it from 51, which gives 13. 
Now, to reach 22, we need to add 9 to 13, and 13 is already in our equation. 
So the equation that works is: 51 - 38 + 9 = 22.
</think>
<answer> 51 - 38 + 9 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list the operations we can use: adding (+), subtracting (-), multiplying (*), and dividing (/). We need to use each number exactly once and they must sum up to 72.
- 78 is the largest number, so it's a good candidate for being a part of the addition/subtraction.
- 28 is the second largest and could be subtracted or added.
- 34 is the smallest.
We can consider the operation (78 - 28) + 34. 
Let's calculate:
(78 - 28) + 34 = 50 + 34 = 84
This doesn't give us 72. Let's try another combination.
Next, consider (78 - 34) + 28: 
Let's calculate:
(78 - 34) + 28 = 44 + 28 = 72
This gives us the required result of 72.
</think>
<answer> (78 - 34) + 28 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use the numbers 73, 20, and 87 to get to 34. I'll start by examining what can be achieved with each number and their possible combinations.
The number 34 is quite close to 73, so maybe subtracting a smaller number or using 73 in some operation will get me there.
Let's try 73 - 20 = 53, which is not what we want. Now let's try 73 - 87 which is -14, not helpful. 
Adding 20 to 87 gives us 107, again not 34.
Using division, 73 / 20 = 3.65, not 34. 
Let's try 87 - 20 = 67, which isn't helpful as we can't get 34 from there.
However, if I subtract numbers in a different order, 87 - 73 = 14.
Now, if I add 20 to 14, I get 34.
Therefore, the equation is 87 - 73 + 20 = 34. </think>
<answer> (87 - 73) + 20 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 3, 70, and 8 that equals 75. Let's start by considering the target number, 75, and the available numbers 3, 70, and 8.
I can see that 70 + 8 = 78, which is very close to 75. So, I need to reduce this sum by 3 to get our target value.
This means I can use subtraction. Therefore, (70 + 8) - 3 = 75.
Finally, I should verify that I've used each number only once and that the equation is correct.
</think>
<answer>(70 + 8) - 3</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to combine 66, 38, and 25 in such a way that I can modify it to get 75. One approach could be to explore the use of multiplication and addition to see if we can get closer to 75 using these numbers.
1) 66 + 38 = 104
   104 - 25 = 79 (Not 75)
2) 66 + 25 = 91
   91 - 38 = 53 (Not 75)
3) 38 + 25 = 63
   66 + 63 = 132 (Not 75)
4) 66 - 25 = 41
   41 + 38 = 79 (Not 75)
5) 66 / 25 = 2.64 (Not an integer, cannot use directly)
Ok, another approach could be exploring different combinations:
6) 38 + 78 = 114 (Exceeding 75)
7) 78 - 38 = 40
   78 - 40 = 38 (Not 75)
8) 78 + 25 - 38 = 65 (Not 75)
9) 66 - 38 = 28
   28 + 25 = 53 (Not 75)
10) 25 * 3 = 75
    But 25 is used already.
11) 78 - 66 = 12
   12 + 38 = 50
   50 + 25 = 75
So, after all attempts, we arrive at an equation using basic arithmetic operations that equals 75: 78 - 66 + 38 + 25 = 75.
</think>
<answer> 78 - 66 + 38 + 25 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 76, 79, and 92. We need to create an equation that equals 95 using these numbers and basic arithmetic operations.
We notice that if we subtract 76 from 92, we get 16. 
If we then add 79 to this result, we get 95 (92 - 76 + 79 = 95).
This uses each number exactly once and follows the rules of using operations only once per number.
</think>
<answer> (92 - 76) + 79 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: [2, 53, 62, 34]. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once to get 50.
- 53 and 62 are quite far from 50, so they might not be directly useful without multiplication or other operations.
- 34 is close to 50 but is odd, so let's consider adding/subtracting 2 to achieve 50.
- Using 2, we can think of multiplication or other combinations.

Given 2, 34 + 2 is 36, which is less than 50. Subtracting 2 from 53 gives 51, which is more than 50. So 34 + 2 does not give us 50.
Multiplying 2 by 26 would give us 52, which is close but not 50. 
Now, 53 - 34 = 19, then we need to get from 19 to 31 to reach 50. Multiplying 19 by 2 would give us 38, which is still not 31.
53 - (34 / 2) = 53 - 17 = 36, this is far from 50. 
Let's try: (62 - 53) + 34 + 2 would be 9 + 34 + 2 = 45. Still not 50.
Finally, let's check: (62 + 53) / 2 = 115 / 2 = 57.5, which is incorrect.
Having further tried, consider: (53 - 34) + 62 / 2 = 19 + 31 = 50!
</think>
<answer> (53 - 34) + 62 / 2 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 21, 93, and 7. We need to form an equation that equals 65 using each number exactly once.
We can start by looking at the operations we have: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
If we look at the target number 65, it seems a straightforward approach involving 93 and 7 might be useful. 93 - 7 equals 86, which is close to 65 if we reduce it by 21. So we need to see if we can form 21 using 21, 93, and 7.
21 can be obtained by dividing 93 by 4.2857 (which is approximately 21), but this approach involves the need for a fractional operation, which isn't straightforward within the given constraints.
Most operations lead us to either a number smaller than 65 or further from 65. However, let's try another combination: 93 - 7 = 86, and then 86 - 21 = 65.
This resembles a direct approach, but we'll cross-check.
</think>
<answer> 93 - 7 - 21 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to combine the numbers 14, 73, and 12 to make 99 using basic operations. Let's start by adding or subtracting the smallest and largest numbers to see if we can get close to 99.
14 + 73 = 87
14 - 73 = -59
Neither gives us 99, so I'll try subtracting the largest from the smallest and adding the middle one:
12 + 14 + 73 = 99
Since all the numbers use only once, this combination is correct.
</think>
<answer> 12 + 14 + 73 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll identify the numbers we have: 37, 74, and 79. We need to get 42 using each of these only once and basic arithmetic operations.
One way to approach this is to look for a combination that simplifies:
Start with 79 - 74 = 5. Now we need to combine 37 with 5 to make 42.
We know that 37 + 5 = 42.
So the equation becomes: 79 - 74 + 37 = 42
</think>
<answer> 79 - 74 + 37 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to create an equation that equals 30 using the numbers 8, 43, and 5. 
Consider the numbers provided. One approach is to use subtraction and addition. 
If we subtract 5 from 43, we get 38. 
Now, we need a way to reach 30 from 38 using the number 8. 
If we subtract 8 from 38, we get 30. 
So the equation would be: 
43 - 5 - 8 = 30.
</think>
<answer> 43 - 5 - 8 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's analyze the numbers we have: 47, 68, and 70. We need to combine these numbers using basic arithmetic operations to get a result of 91. 
To get 91, one straightforward way could be adding 47 and 44 and then subtracting 3. However, since 44 is not one of the numbers we have, we need to think creatively about the numbers we can use.
Another approach could be using 70, 68, and 3. We know that 70 + 68 equals 138, and if we subtract 47, we get 91. This seems promising.
Using 70, 68, and 47, we can create the equation: 70 + 68 - 47 = 91.
</think>
<answer> 70 + 68 - 47 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers given: 72, 31, and 69. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once which equals 34. 
One quick observation is that 72 and 69 are both close to 70. We can subtract 69 from 72, but we need to balance this by using the remaining numbers.
Another possibility is to divide one of the numbers by another and see if we can get the result of 34. Dividing 72 by 31 gives approximately 2. 32, which is not 34. However, if we subtract 31 from 69 and then add the result to 72, it might work.
Let's try: 72 - 31 + 69. This gives us 72 - 31 = 41, and then 41 + 69 = 110. This doesn't equal 34.
Let's try another combination: 72 - (31 + 69). Here, we are only using the numbers once; 31 + 69 = 100, and then 72 - 100 = -28. This also doesn't equal 34.
We need to think about multiplication or another combination. Let's try: (72 / 31) + 69. This would give us (72 / 31) which is approximately 2. 32, and then adding 69 would not give us 34.
Finally, let's try: (72 - 31) / 69 + 31. Here, we subtract 31 from 72 to get 41, and then divide by 69 to get approximately 0. 60. Finally, adding 31 gives us 0. 60 + 31 = 31. 60.
None of these seem to work directly, so we have to consider the possibility directly subtract from the total. One possibility that hasn't been only considered is using the numbers in a different combination. Let's reconsider: 72 - 31 - 69. This would give (72 - 31) = 41, further reduced by 69 = -28. 
This doesn't work. Let's think differently: 31 + (72 - 69). 72 - 69 is 3, and then adding 31 results in 34. It satisfies the condition of using the numbers exactly once.
</think>
<answer> 31 + (72 - 69) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's examine the numbers we have: 72, 31, and 69. We need to find a way to use these numbers exactly once to get 34 using basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by seeing if any of the numbers need to be transformed. For instance, if we could divide 69 by something, it might help us get closer to 34. 69 divided by 31 gives us a value slightly less than 2, closer to 2.32. This itself doesn't help, but if we can manipulate the numbers by subtraction or addition, we might find a solution.
Let's consider combining 72 and 31: 72 - 31 = 41, which is far from 34. Next, let's consider another combination: (72 - 69) + 31 = 3 + 31 = 34. This combination works.
So, the equation is (72 - 69) + 31 = 34.
</think>
<answer>(72 - 69) + 31</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use the numbers 27, 71, and 67 to get 31. Quite a challenge given the numbers! Let's break it down:
- Multiplying 71 and 67 gives us 4757, which is too big.
- Subtracting or adding these numbers won't get us close to 31 either.
- Considering division: 67 divided by 27 is just over 2, and 71 divided by 27 is just under 2. So, a division operation might be key.
- Adding 27 to the result of dividing 71 by 27 might help us reach 31 or get close.
- Let's calculate: (71 / 27) + 27 = 2.63 + 27 ≈ 29.63. This is close but not quite there.
- Now let's think about subtracting instead of adding: (71 / 27) - 27 = 2.63 - 27 ≈ -24.37. This is negative and too low.
From these calculations, it appears the key lies in using subtraction first and adding the result to 27 to get to 31.
- (71 - 67) = 4
- Then, 27 + 4 = 31
</think>
<answer> (71 - 67) + 27 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 70, 80, and 68. We need to use each number exactly once and combine them using basic arithmetic operations to get 78. 
- Adding 68 and 10 will give us 78. However, 10 is not given as one of the numbers. 
- We can incorporate 70 and 80 in some way.
- 80 - 68 = 12, and then 12 + 70 should give us a value close to 78. 
- If we take 12 and add it to 70, we get 82, which is off by 4 from 78.
- Instead, let's subtract 12 from 80, which gives 68. Now we need 2 to reach 78.
- We have 70 and 68. Subtracting 68 from 70 gives us 2.
- So, 80 - (70 - 68) should give us the required 78.
</think>
<answer> 80 - (70 - 68) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 78 using the numbers 70, 80, and 68 exactly once. I should check combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
I see that if I subtract 68 from 80 and then add 70, I can reach 78. 
80 - 68 = 12, and then
12 + 70 = 82
This is not quite 78. 
However, if I subtract 70 from 80 first, I get:
80 - 70 = 10
And then adding 68:
10 + 68 = 78
This gives me the desired result of 78.
</think>
<answer> 80 - 70 + 68 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 70, 80, and 68 exactly once to equal 78. Looking at the numbers, 80 - 68 = 12 seems like a useful result. But, 78 - 12 = 66 is not using the number 70. So, let's try changing the order of operations. If I add 70 to 12 (80 - 68), I get 92. However, this isn't 78.
Now, let's try another combination: 80 + 68 - 70. This gives 148 - 70 = 78. This combination works perfectly as it uses each of the numbers once, and it equals 78.
</think>
<answer> 80 + 68 - 70 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers provided: 21, 30, and 60. We need to use each number exactly once and basic arithmetic operations to get 51.
Let's start with the operations we can use: +, -, *, /.
If we take 60 and subtract 30, we get 30. Now we need 21 more to reach 51.
This leaves us with (60 - 30) + 21 = 51.
</think>
<answer> (60 - 30) + 21 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 28, 56, and 61. We need to use each number exactly once to create an equation that equals 89.
- Adding the numbers: 28 + 56 + 61 = 145, which is too large.
- Subtracting the numbers: 61 - 28 - 56 = -23, which is too small.
- Multiplying or dividing these numbers will not directly give us 89 either.
However, let's try combining them in a different way.
If we subtract the smaller two numbers from the largest, we get: 61 - 28 - 56 = -23.
This result is not useful. Now, let's think about addition in a different way.
If we add 1 to 89 but substitute 1 with the sum of the other two numbers, we will need to subtract that sum from 89 first.
So, (89 - (28 + 56)) = 89 - 84 = 5. 
This is still not 89. 
Next, let's try: (61 + 56) - 28 = 117 - 28 = 89.
Now, this gives us the correct result.
</think>
<answer> (61 + 56) - 28 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find out how I can use the numbers 51, 35, and 57 just once to get 41. Let's start by seeing if I can combine these numbers using arithmetic operations.
One strategy is to see if I can subtract or add these numbers in a way that gets close to 41. Trying combinations:
- 51 - 57 = -6
- 57 - 51 = 6
- 51 - 35 = 16
- 57 - 35 = 22
- 35 - 51 = -16
None of these are 41.
Now let's try combining operations:
- 51 - 57 + 35 = 35 - 57 + 35 = -2 (which is not 41)
- 51 + 35 - 57 = 86 - 57 = 29 (which is not 41)
- 57 - 51 + 35 = 6 + 35 = 41 (which is what I'm looking for)
So the equation that gives 41 using the numbers 51, 35, and 57 is 57 - 51 + 35.
</think>
<answer> 57 - 51 + 35 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list out the numbers we have: 47, 70, and 76. We need to create an equation that equals 41 using each number exactly once.
We can consider various combinations of operations. The operation 70 - 76 = -6 doesn't help much.
Adding 47 to these numbers might not yield 41, so let's subtract 47 from 70 first to see if we can get closer to 41.
70 - 47 = 23.
Now we need to get from 23 to 41 using the remaining number, 76. The obvious move is to subtract 76 from 23, but that doesn't give us our target.
Instead, let's try another approach with the numbers in this order: 47 - (76 - 70) = 47 - 6 = 41.
</think>
<answer> 47 - (76 - 70) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 19, 13, and 53. We need to create an equation that equals 21 using these numbers once each.
We can start by checking if we can get close to 21 by adding or subtracting these numbers. Adding 19 and 13 gives us 32, which is too much. Subtracting 13 from 19 gives us 6.
Now, if we add 6 to 53, we get 59, which is also too much. If we subtract 53 from 19, we get -36, which is not close to 21.
Multiplying or dividing these numbers might give us an answer closer to 21, but let's try combinations first.
Let's check if 53 - 19 gives us a number close to 12: 53 - 19 = 34. Now, if we subtract 13 from 34, we get 21, which is exactly what we need.
Therefore, the equation is: 53 - 19 - 13 = 21.
</think>
<answer> 53 - 19 - 13 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 81, 71, and 19 that equals 29. One approach is to use subtraction as it can help reduce the larger numbers to smaller ones. If I subtract 19 from 71, I get 52. Now, subtracting 52 from 81 should give me closer to the result we want, which is 29. So, 81 - 71 - 19 = 81 - 71 - 19 = 0, which is not correct. Let's try reversing the order: 81 - 71 + 19 = 81 - 71 + 19 = 29. Now we have applied all the numbers and we are getting the result we desire. </think>
<answer> 81 - 71 + 19 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 70 using the numbers 38, 26, 91, and 9. Let's start by looking at the numbers and what we can do with them. One approach is to see if I can get close to 70 by combining two of the numbers and then adjust with the others.
- 91 - 26 = 65
- Now we need 5 more to reach 70. We are left with 9 and 38.
- 9 + 38 = 47, which is not enough.
- Let's try another combination: 91 - 38 = 53.
- Now we need 30 more to reach 70. We can get this by 26 - 9.
- So, (91 - 38) + (26 - 9) = 53 + 17 = 70.
</think>
<answer> (91 - 38) + (26 - 9) </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to create an equation that equals 66 using the numbers 86, 21, and 1, each exactly once. Looking at the numbers available, 86 seems like an odd number to work with directly to reach 66, but we can subtract 20 from it to get 66. Now we need to make 20 using the number 21 and 1.
We can use the numbers 21 and 1 in the following way: subtract 1 from 21 to get 20.
So, the equation can be formed as: 86 - 21 + 1.
Now, let's evaluate the equation: 86 - 21 = 65, and 65 + 1 = 66.
</think>
<answer> 86 - 21 + 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 2, 11, and 36. To reach 58, we need to think about how to combine these numbers using basic arithmetic operations. 
Taking 36 as it is, we need to reach 12 from adding or subtracting 2 and 11. 
- If we add 2 and 11, we get 13, which is not 12. 
- If we subtract 11 from 22 (which is 2+11), we get 11, not 12. 
We need 12, so let's consider if there's another way to manipulate the numbers. 
Notice that 22 (which is 2+11) minus 11 equals 11, and 11 minus 2 again equals 9. 
Then we have 12 (2+10, but since 10 isn't a given number, we'll use 2+11-10 = 11) plus 17 to reach 28.
Finally, we need 30 to reach 50, and then 58 is 50+11+8, but now 8 isn't a number. 
Let's try to find a simpler path: 
If we take 36 and 2 which give us 38, then we need 20 more to get to 58. 
Thus, 20 = 11 + 9. Now we need 9 from these numbers.
We already have 11, so we need to get 0 from 2 and 11 using subtraction: 
2 - 11 + 11 = 2.
So, the numbers 2, 11, and 36 can generate 58 by the expression (2 - 11 + 11) * 36 + (2 + 11 - 11) = 2 * 36 + 2 = 72 + 2 = 74, which is not 58. 
Let's try another step: 
If we use 2 * 11 = 22 and add 36 would give us 58. Hence, the equation is 2 * 11 + 36 = 58.
</think>
<answer> 2 * 11 + 36 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to construct an equation using the numbers 17, 24, and 45 that equals 86. We can start by looking at the numbers and seeing which operations might work. If we add 17 and 24, we get 41. Now, we need to reach 86 from this 41. Adding 45 to 41 does not get us there. Instead, we can consider a different operation. If we multiply 17 and 24, we get 408, which is far from 86. Let's try other combinations. Multiplying 17 and 45 gives us 765, which is also not correct. The only logical step left is to consider using subtraction. If we subtract 45 from 24, we get -21, which is not helpful. However, if we can add 45 to another number and subtract 24 from 17, we could achieve the result. 45 + 17 = 62, and then 62 - 24 = 38, which is still not 86. Reevaluating, if we take 45 - 24 = 21 and then add 17, we get 38 + 46, which isn't 86. Finally, let's consider: 45 - (24 - 17) = 45 - 7 = 38, and then adding 46 gives us 84. This isn't working out either. Given the numbers, the only feasible equation is 45 + 24 - 17 = 52, which is still not 86. Now considering the mistake, the correct operation would be: 45 - (24 - 17) = 45 - 7 = 38. We need to add 46 to it, but the numbers cannot be repeated. Let me try -17 + 24 + 45 = 52. Now if I subtract 16, we're close to 86. But since 16 is not among the numbers, it seems no other combination fits perfectly. The direct correct method is: 45 + 24 - 17 = 52, and then the correct equation should be: 45 + 24 - 17 = 52, plus adding another 34, which isn't available. The only workable answer fitting available numbers is: 45 + 24 - 17 = 52. Nevertheless, it doesn't reach 86 directly. Thus, the only logical grouping and arithmetic that works accurately fitting these numbers with basic operations is: 24 + 45 + 17 - 10 = 86. Error in previous attempts rounding up. Correct straightforward grouping: 45 + 24 + 17 = 86. </think>
<answer> 45 + 24 + 17 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 11, 97, and 13 that equals 99. One way to start is to see if I can use subtraction to bring down values. If I subtract 11 from 97, I get 86. Then, I would need to add 13 to 86 to reach 99. Let's check: 
97 - 11 = 86
86 + 13 = 99
This gives us the equation 97 - 11 + 13 = 99.
</think>
<answer> (97 - 11) + 13 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the target number, which is 51. Now, looking at the numbers available 55, 11, 2, and 35, I notice that 55 and 35 are values away from 51, so I might be able to use subtraction to adjust the total.
55 - 35 = 20
Now, I have 20, but need to reach 51. So, I will add the next number, 11:
20 + 11 = 31
I still need 21 more. Looking at 2, I see this is a key number to help get 21:
31 + 2 = 33
This is over 51 by 2, so I'll subtract 2:
33 - 2 = 31
I'm now 10 short of 51. With the number 2 left, I can reach my target:
31 + 2 = 33
Finally, to reach 51, add 18:
33 + 18 = 51
This doesn't use the 2 correctly, so instead:
31 + 2 - 10 = 33
But this doesn't match 51.
I'll reconsider using 2 directly:
31 + 2 - 10 = 33
Not right.
Let's use a different approach with the numbers:
(55 - 35) * 2 + 11 = 51
Now, this expression uses all numbers exactly once and gives us the result:
(55 - 35) * 2 + 11 = 51
</think>
<answer> (55 - 35) * 2 + 11 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to come up with an equation using the numbers 69, 16, and 21 that equals 74. I'll start by considering how I can combine these numbers to reach 74. One way to approach this is to look for a combination that uses subtraction or addition to bring the sum close to 74.
If I take 69 and 21 and perform an operation, I get:
69 + 21 = 90
Now, to reach 74 from 90, I need to subtract 16. So the equation becomes:
69 + 21 - 16 = 74
</think>
<answer> (69 + 21) - 16 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 69, 16, and 21. We need to create an equation that equals 74 using these numbers exactly once and basic arithmetic operations.
One possible approach is to try combining the numbers with addition and subtraction. If we add and subtract the numbers in a particular way, the equation might work.
Let's try: 69 - 16 + 21
69 - 16 = 53
53 + 21 = 74
So, this combination gives us the result we need. </think>
<answer> 69 - 16 + 21 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 25, 12, and 16. We need to create an equation that equals 53. 
A good way to approach this is to consider if adding or subtracting any of these numbers will get us closer to 53.
Looking at the numbers, we notice that 25 is already quite close to 53. If we subtract 12 and 16 from 25, we get:
25 - 12 - 16 = -3
This is not 53, but if we think about it in a different way, we can use the positive values of these numbers.
Instead of subtracting, if we add 12 and 16 to 25, we get:
25 + 12 + 16 = 53
This gives us the target number 53.
</think>
<answer> (25 + 12 + 16) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 25, 12, and 16. We need to create an equation that equals 53 using these numbers only once.
Looking at 53, we see that 25 + 28 would give us the number we need. However, we don't have an 28 directly. 
If we use 16 + 12 = 28, then 25 + 28 = 53.
This means we can use:
16 + 12 = 28
Adding 25 to 28 gives us 53.
So the equation is 25 + (16 + 12) = 53.
</think>
<answer> 25 + (16 + 12) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 76, 83, and 91. We need to use these numbers once each to create an equation that equals 84.
We can start by looking at combinations of addition and subtraction:
- 91 - 83 = 8, which is far from 84.
- 91 - 76 = 15, which is also far from 84.
- 83 - 76 = 7, and considering 83 + 76 - 91 would be 78, which is closer but not 84.
- 83 - (91 - 76) = 83 - 15 = 68, which is not 84.
- Considering multiplication and division alone might not get us closer. 
- Adding the numbers together gives 76 + 83 + 91 = 250, which is too large.
We see that some combination of operations might involve using them in a different way. Another useful approach is:
- (91 - 83) * 1 = 8, which is not good.
- Instead, consider (91 - 83) + 76 = 8 + 76 = 84.
So, the equation would be 8 (which is 91 - 83) + 76.
</think>
<answer> (91 - 83) + 76 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 76, 83, and 91 that equals 84. Let's start with combining these numbers using basic arithmetic operations.
I'll consider how 84 relates to these numbers:
- 91 - 76 = 15
- 91 - 83 = 8
- 83 - 76 = 7
None of these directly gives us 84.
Let's try combinations:
- 76 + 83 = 159 (too large)
- 83 + 91 = 174 (too large)
- 91 + 76 = 167 (too large)
- 91 - 76 = 15 (too small)
I already excluded 84 itself, so I'll look for another possibility:
- (83 - 76) * 2 = 7 (this isn't 84)
- Using division or negating numbers: No straightforward way with the numbers provided.
Maybe if I try 91 minus a part of 83 and 76:
- 91 - (83 - 76) = 91 - 7 = 84
This looks promising!
So the equation is 91 - (83 - 76) = 84.
</think>
<answer> 91 - (83 - 76) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 46, 75, 36, and 65. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once to equal 58.
- 46 + 75 = 121 (too large)
- 75 - 36 = 39 (not 58)
- 46 + 36 = 82 (too large)
- 75 - 46 = 29 (not 58)
- 65 - 36 = 29 (not 58)
- 46 - 36 = 10 (not 58)
- 75 - 65 = 10 (not 58)
- 46 + 65 = 111 (too large)
- 75 - 36 - 46 = 75 - 82 = -17 (not 58)
Now, let's try a different combination:
- 75 - 36 - 46 = 9
- This is closer, we just need 69 to reach 58
- We already have 65, we just need 4 more
- 65 - 36 = 29 (which we need 29 more)
- Now we need 29 - 36 which is negative and we don't have a + sign
- So let's try another way with just the numbers we have
65 + 36 - 46 - 75 = 101 - 121 (too small)
65 - 46 + 36 - 75 = 19 - 39 (not 58)
65 + 46 - 75 - 36 = 111 - 111 (too large)
65 + 36 - 75 - 46 = 101 - 121 = -19 (negative)
Let's try 46 + 65 - 75 - 36 = 111 - 111 (not 58)
No, actually I get it now:
65 + 36 - 75 - 46 = 101 - 121 = -19 (negative)
The correct sequence should be:
46 + 36 - 65 - 75 which does not yield 58 
But 65 + 36 - 46 - 75 = -18
Let's try 75 - (46 + 36) + 65 = 58
And thus that totals 58
</think>
<answer> 75 - (46 + 36) + 65 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list what we need to get to 26:
We have the numbers 84, 83, and 25.
Let's try subtracting the smallest number from the largest:
84 - 83 = 1
This gives us 1, which is too low.
Next, let's try subtracting the smallest from the middle number:
84 - 25 = 59
This gives us 59, which is too high.
Now, let's try adding the middle number to the smallest:
84 + 25 = 109
This is also too high.
Then, let's see if combining different operations can lead to 26:
Consider (84 - 83) + 25:
This equals 1 + 25 = 26, which is what we need.
So the correct equation is (84 - 83) + 25.
</think>
<answer> (84 - 83) + 25 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list out the basic arithmetic operations we can use: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). Our goal is to arrange these numbers 67, 22, and 5 to form an equation that equals 84.
Let's consider using multiplication and addition as they can quickly get us closer to 84 with our starting numbers. Multiplying 67 by 22 gives us 1474, which is too high. Multiplying 67 by 5 gives us 335, still too high.
Now, let's try subtraction and addition. If we subtract 5 from 67, we get 62. Adding 22 to this gives us 84.
So, the equation would be:
67 - 5 + 22 = 84
</think>
<answer> 67 - 5 + 22 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 15, 70, and 46. We need to form an equation that results in 39. 
We can start by considering the operations we can use:
- Addition: 15 + 70 + 46 = 131 (which is too large)
- Subtraction: 70 - 46 = 24, 70 - 15 = 55, 46 - 15 = 31 (none of these give us 39)
- Multiplication: 15 * 70 = 1050 (too large)
- Division: 70 / 15 = 4. 66... (not an integer), 46 / 15 = 3. 07... (not an integer)
Given these, we need to leverage the numbers in a different way. Notice that if we rearrange the numbers, we might get closer to our target. Let's consider 70 - 15 - 46:
70 - 15 - 46 = 70 - 61 = 9 (which is still not 39).
Now, let's try another approach: 70 - 15 = 55 and then subtract 36 (which we can find by 70 - 46):
55 - (70 - 46) = 55 - 24 = 31 (still not 39).
Another trial would be to use division in a strategic way:
70 / 15 gives us approximately 4. 67, not helpful.
Finally, let's try another strategy: using 70 + 46 - 15:
70 + 46 - 15: 116 - 15 = 101 (too large).
Considering all these trials, it seems we're not on track. We missed combinations like multiplication or more strategic division:
70 / 15 = 4. 67... (not usable).
15 + (70 - 46) = 15 + 24 = 39.
This equation works as 15 + 24 = 39.
</think>
<answer> 15 + (70 - 46) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 46, 12, and 2. We need to form an equation that equals 32 using these numbers exactly once.
- Adding or subtracting these numbers would result in a number significantly larger or smaller than 32, respectively.
- Multiplying 46 by 2 gives us 92, which is too large, and multiplying the other pairs will similarly yield results that are out of our desired range.
- Adding 12 and 2 gives us 14, which when subtracted from 46 gives us 32. This looks promising.
Therefore, the equation we form is 46 - (12 + 2) = 32.
</think>
<answer> 46 - (12 + 2) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 92, 24, and 66. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) that equals 50.
- Starting with the numbers, let's try combinations.
- If we subtract the smallest number from the largest, we get 92 - 66 = 26, which is too high.
- Trying combinations with 24, 92 - 24 = 68, also too high.
- If we consider 92 - 24 - 66 = 2, still too low.
- Let's try 92 - 24 + 66 = 134, definitely too high.
- Now, let's try 92 + 24 - 66 = 50, which is exactly what we're looking for.
</think>
<answer> 92 + 24 - 66 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers provided: 48, 64, and 91. We need to find a way to use these numbers exactly once to get a result of 21. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
One approach is to try to combine the numbers in a way that one operation cancels out with another.
48 + 64 = 112
This is too high.
Now let's try 91 - 64 = 27
Still too high.
Now, let's try (91 - 64) / 48
(91 - 64) / 48 = 27 / 48 = 0. 5625
This is not 21.
Now let's try (91 - 64) / (48 / 4)
(91 - 64) / (48 / 4) = 27 / 12 = 2. 25
This is not 21.
Let's try a new combo: 64 + (91 - 48)
64 + (91 - 48) = 64 + 43 = 107
This is too high.
Now let's try another combo: (91 / 48) + 64
(91 / 48) + 64 is a bit close, but not exact.
We'll try 64 - 91 + 48
64 - 91 + 48 = -27 + 48 = 21
This works.
</think>
<answer> 64 - 91 + 48 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 7, 91, and 43 that equals 41. 
First, let's look at the numbers and consider possible operations. Notice that 91 - 43 = 48, which is close to 41 and provides a useful intermediate step.
Then, we have 7, and we need to get from 48 to 41. We could subtract 7 from 48 to get 41.
So, the equation would be: (91 - 43) - 7 = 41.
</think>
<answer> (91 - 43) - 7 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to create an equation that equals 65 using the numbers 19, 11, and 57 exactly once each with basic arithmetic operations. Let's start by looking at the numbers available:
- 19
- 11
- 57
The goal is 65, so we need to work out how these can combine using addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
If we subtract 11 from 57, we get 46. Then if we add 19 to 46, we get:
57 - 11 = 46
46 + 19 = 65
So, the equation that works is 57 - 11 + 19.
</think>
<answer> 57 - 11 + 19 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 20, 72, and 8 that equals 60. I'll start by considering possible operations and combinations with these numbers.
72 - 20 = 52
Now, 52 - 8 doesn't work since that would be 50.
52 - 8 = 44
Now, 44 + 6 = 50, but 6 is not one of our numbers.
20 + 8 = 28
Now, adding 32 to 28 doesn't directly work either.
Considering multiplication could offer a different route:
72 * 8 = 576
This is way too large. 
Combining the number we have, 20 and 8:
20 * 8 = 160
And then needing to subtract 100, but we don't have 100.
Now, let's try a different approach:
8 * 3 = 24
20 - 24 = -4
We have -4 and need to make 60. 
Perhaps there's an alternative if we try 72:
72 / 3 = 24
20 - 24 = -4
To reach 60, we need to use the remaining 8. 
So, 72 - 20 = 52, and 52 + 8 = 60.
</think>
<answer> 72 - 20 + 8 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use the numbers 59, 46, and 89 to get 76. I'll start with basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
I notice that if I subtract 46 from 59, I get 13. Then if I add 89 to 13, I get 102.
So, the equation becomes: 59 - 46 + 89 = 102.
This is close but not exactly 76. Let me try another combination. If I first perform 59 + 46, I get 105. Then if I subtract 29 (which is 89 - 60, not possible, so I need to rethink), I can instead multiply 59 by 2 to get 118, and subtract 42 (which is 89 - 47, again not feasible) or add and subtract the numbers differently.
Another attempt would be: I could consider 89 - 59 = 30, and then try to use 46 somewhere. Adding 46 to 30 will give 76. So the equation would be: (89 - 59) + 46 = 76.
</think>
<answer> (89 - 59) + 46 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's analyze the numbers we have: [58, 61, 93]. We need to use each number exactly once and combine them using basic arithmetic operations to get 26.
- If we consider subtraction, 93 - 61 = 32, which is far from 26.
- If we consider addition, 58 + 61 = 119, which is also too high.
- Considering multiplication or division alone won't work here because even the largest product (93 * 61) is much too high, and the smallest or simple division (58 / 61) doesn't yield 26.
Given these initial observations, let's try a combination:
One possible approach could be 93 - 61 - 58. But this gives 93 - 61 = 32, then 32 - 58 is negative and already not 26.
Looking at the numbers again, let's try 61 - 93 + 58. Here's the step-by-step calculation:
61 - 93 = -32
-32 + 58 = 26
</think>
<answer> 61 - 93 + 58 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 49, 32, 14. We need to combine these using basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) so that the result is 31. We can try different combinations starting with addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
1. Addition: 49 + 32 + 14 = 95 (too big)
2. Subtraction: 49 - 32 + 14 = 31 (this seems promising)
3. Multiplication: 49 * 32 * 14 = 21152 (too big)
4. Division: 49 / 32 * 14 (results in a decimal) (not possible)
From the above steps, 49 - 32 + 14 does equal 31, using only the numbers once. </think>
<answer> (49 - 32) + 14 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 16, 41, and 30. We need to create an equation that equals 55 using each number only once and with basic arithmetic operations.
- We can start by checking possible combinations of these numbers using addition and subtraction.
- Adding 41 and 16 gives us 57, which is not 55.
- Subtracting 16 from 41 gives us 25, then adding 30 gives us 55.
- Therefore, the equation is 41 - 16 + 30 = 55.
</think>
<answer> (41 - 16) + 30 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 16, 41, and 30. We need to create an equation using these numbers that equals 55. We can try different combinations of the numbers and the operations.
- Starting with 41, we need to get to 55. We can subtract 16 from 41 to get 25.
- Next, we need to get from 25 to 55. We can do this by adding 30.
So, the equation would be 41 - 16 + 30 = 55.
</think>
<answer> (41 - 16) + 30 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's identify that we need to reach 63 using the numbers 73, 52, 6, and 2. We should consider possible combinations of operations.
- Multiplying 73 by 6 gives us 438, which is close but too high.
- Adding 73 and 52 gives us 125, which is also too high.
- Subtracting 73 from 52 gives us -21, which is too low.
- Multiplying 52 by 2 gives us 104, which is still too high.
- Subtracting 2 from 73 gives us 71, closer but still a bit too high.
- Trying 62 with -1 by subtracting (73-1) but we only have 6 and 2 available.
- What if we use division instead? Dividing 73 by 2 gives us 36.5. Now if we take 52 and subtract 36. 5, we have 15. 5. Then adding 6 to that is 21. 5, far from 63.
- Using 2 as a multiplier 2*52=104, again too high.
- The only possible way seems to use 6 as a multiplier and subtract or divide, but we need to get closer.
- Finally, consider 73-52 = 21, then find a way to get close to 63 with the remaining 6 and 2.
The correct approach could be: (73 - 52) * 6 / 2 = 21 * 6 / 2 = 126 / 2 = 63.
</think>
<answer> (73 - 52) * 6 / 2 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's examine the numbers given: 96, 30, 71, and 27. Our goal is to create an equation that equals 82 using each number exactly once.
Starting with the numbers, we can see 96 - 71 = 25. This leaves us with 30 and 27 to use. We also have 82 - 25 = 57, which should use the remaining numbers.
Now, let's try 30 + 27 = 57. This fits, as 96 - 71 + 30 + 27 = 82.
</think>
<answer> (96 - 71) + 30 + 27 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 96, 30, 71, and 27 exactly once to equal 82. Looking at the numbers, I can see that 96 and 27 are quite large, while 30 and 71 are more moderate. Subtracting 71 from 96 gives me 25. Now I need to adjust this to reach 82. Adding 30 to 25 gives me 55. Finally, I need to reach from 55 to 82. This means I need to add 27. Therefore, the equation is 96 - 71 + 30 + 27 = 82.
</think>
<answer> 96 - 71 + 30 + 27 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 35, 12, 35, and 18. We need to use each number exactly once to make the equation equal 76.
We can start by adding 35 and 18, which gives us 53. Now we need to reach 76 from 53. The difference between 76 and 53 is 23. Now we see that 12 and 35 don't easily lend themselves to getting 23 using basic arithmetic operations. Instead, we can use subtraction and addition.
35 - 12 = 23. Now, to get 76, we add 23 to our initial sum of 53:
53 + 23 = 76.
Thus, the equation becomes: (35 - 12) + (35 + 18) = 76.
</think>
<answer> (35 - 12) + (35 + 18) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 35, 12, 35, and 18. We need to use these once each to make the equation equal 76.
We can see that 35 + 35 equals 70, which is close to 76. Adding 6 would give us 76. 
Looking at the remaining numbers, we see that 18 - 12 = 6.
Therefore, we can construct the equation as follows: (35 + 35) + (18 - 12) = 76.
</think>
<answer> (35 + 35) + (18 - 12) </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to use the numbers 53, 27, and 15 exactly once to get the result 11. Let's start by considering what we can do with these numbers.
- Adding or subtracting these numbers won't give us 11, because the smallest sum we can make (15 + 27) is 42 and the largest sum (53 + 27 + 15) is 95.
- Multiplying them directly doesn't work, as 53 * 27 * 15 would be an enormous number.
- Division could work, but we need to find a combination that yields the exact result of 11.
Now let's try: 15 - 27 / 53. This doesn't give us 11.
Next, let's try: (53 - 27) / 15 = 26 / 15, which isn't 11 either.
Finally, let's try: (53 - 27) + 15 = 26 + 15 = 41, which also isn't 11.
Now we find that (53 - 27) - 15 is (26 - 15) = 11, this gives us the correct result.
</think>
<answer> (53 - 27 - 15) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers 31, 29, and 79. We need to form an equation using these numbers with basic arithmetic operations that results in 77, and each number can only be used once.
- One way to approach this is to see which numbers can be combined to get close to 77.
- Adding 31 and 29 gives us 60.
- To get 77 from 60, we need to add 17.
- We see that 79 - 31 = 48, which isn't helpful.
- If we try another combination, we see that 79 - 29 = 50, and then we need 27 more to reach 77.
- 31 - 24 = 7, and 50 + 7 = 57, that's still not 77.
- Trying again, we find 79 - 31 - 29 = 19, and 77 - 19 = 58, which isn't helping either.
- Now let's try: 79 - 31 = 48, and using 29 as it is, see if we can form 77 with these.
- We see 48 + 29 = 77, exactly what we need.
- Therefore, the equation is 79 - 31 + 29 = 77.
</think>
<answer> 79 - 31 + 29 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list the numbers we have: 31, 29, and 79. We need to use each one exactly once and combine them using basic arithmetic operations to get 77.
We can start by seeing if we can form 77 by adding or subtracting some of these numbers. Notice that 31 + 29 = 60, which is close but not 77. Let's try another approach: 79 - 31 - 29 = 19, which is still not 77.
Now, let's consider multiplication and division: If we multiply 31 and 29, we get 899, which is far from 77. Similarly, various combinations of division don't get us to 77.
The key now is to consider if there's a way to use the numbers in a different order or with combination of operations. Let's try subtracting to form a smaller number and then adding to reach 77.
31 - 29 = 2. Now we need 75 more to reach 77. 75 can be written as 79 - 32, but 32 isn't directly available. However, we can rearrange the operations. Let's try the inverse: 79 - (31 - 29) = 79 - 2 = 77.
</think>
<answer> 79 - (31 - 29) </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to create an equation that equals 76 using the numbers 81, 99, and 94 exactly once. Let's start by looking at what we can do with these numbers.
- Adding any of these numbers will give us a result over 100, which is not what we want.
- Subtracting the smallest from the largest gives 94 - 81 = 13, which is too small.
- Multiplying or dividing the numbers will give us results that are either too large or not close to 76.
Now, let's try a different combination: 99 - 81 = 18. Now if we subtract 18 from 94, we get 94 - 18 = 76. This works!
</think>
<answer> 94 - (99 - 81) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 12, 43, and 3. We need an equation that results in 58 using these numbers exactly once.
To get close to 58, we can start by looking at the larger numbers. The sum of 43 and 12 is 55, which is not far from 58. Adding the third number, 3, to this sum gives us 58.
So, the equation is 43 + 12 + 3 = 58.
</think>
<answer> 43 + 12 + 3 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 58, 35, and 13. We need to create an equation that equals 10 using each of these numbers only once and basic arithmetic operations.
- Adding or subtracting any two of these numbers won't get us close to 10.
- Multiplying or dividing might be more promising. 
Let's try 58 - 35 = 23, and then 23 - 13 = 10. This way we are using each number exactly once.
</think>
<answer> (58 - 35) - 13 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 58, 35, and 13. We need to use each number exactly once to get a result of 10 using basic arithmetic operations.
- We can start by looking at the subtraction of two numbers to see if we get a suitable number for the third operation.
- If we subtract 35 from 58, we get 23.
- Now, we have 23 and 13 left.
- If we subtract 13 from 23, we get 10.
So, the equation is: 23 - 13 = 10.
However, we need to use each number exactly once, and we haven't used 58 yet. Let's try another combination:
- We can also consider the division of 58 by 35 to get a decimal, and then add 13 to reach 10.
- 58 / 35 is approximately 1. 657...
- Adding 13 to this result gives us about 14. 657, which is not 10.
- Now, let's try another combination: adding 35 and 13 and then subtracting 58:
- 35 + 13 = 48
- Then 48 - 58 = -10
This equation is not correct either.
- Let's consider multiplication and division together: (58 * 13) / 35 = 1324 / 35 ≈ 37. 857
- It's clear that no other combination will work using these numbers exactly once.
The only correct and plausible equation using these numbers exactly once is the first alternative: 23 - 13 = 10.
</think>
<answer> (58 - 35) - 13 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to create an equation from the numbers 72, 61, 31, and 63 that equals 39 using basic arithmetic operations. Let's start by looking at the numbers and trying different combinations:
- 72 - 61 = 11 (not 39)
- 72 - 31 = 41 (not 39)
- 72 - 63 = 9 (not 39)
- 61 - 31 = 30 (not 39)
- 61 - 63 = -2 (not 39)
- 63 - 31 = 32 (not 39)
- 72 + 31 = 103 (not 39)
- 72 + 61 = 133 (not 39)
- 61 + 31 = 92 (not 39)
- 63 + 31 = 94 (not 39)
- 72 * 31 = 2232 (not 39)
- 72 * 61 = 4392 (not 39)
- 61 * 31 = 1901 (not 39)
- 63 * 31 = 1953 (not 39)
Also, combining numbers differently:
- 72 + 61 - 63 = 70 - 63 = 7 (not 39)
- 72 + 31 - 61 = 103 - 61 = 42 (not 39)
- 61 + 31 - 72 = 92 - 72 = 20 (not 39)
- 63 + 31 - 72 = 94 - 72 = 22 (not 39)
We've exhausted creating equations with these numbers using addition, subtraction, and multiplication, but we haven't tried division. Let's try:
- 72 / 61 = 1.188 (not an integer and not 39)
- 61 / 63 = 0.968 (not 39)
- 63 / 31 = 2.032 (not 39)
- 31 / 61 = 0.509 (not 39)
- 63 / 61 = 1.033 (not 39)
- 72 / 31 = 2.322 (not 39)
Finally, combining division with the others:
- 63 / 31 * 61 - 72 = 2.032 * 61 - 72 = 123.232 - 72 = 51.232 (not 39)
We've come to realize that using the given numbers and basic operations we have to find an equation that results in 39. Let's try using different operations or combination:
- 72 - 61 + 31 - 63 = 10 + 31 - 63 = 41 - 63 = -23 (not 39)
- 72 - 63 + 61 - 31 = 9 + 61 - 31 = 70 - 31 = 39 (this works)
So, a valid equation that equals 39 using the numbers 72, 61, 31, and 63 is 72 - 63 + 61 - 31 = 39.
</think>
<answer> 72 - 63 + 61 - 31 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 60, 15, 75, and 39 that equals 81. Let's start by looking at the numbers and the arithmetic operations we can use.
60 + 15 = 75
75 + 75 = 150 (This is too large, so I won't use this combination)
60 + 39 = 99 (Still too large)
75 + 39 = 114 (Still too large)
15 * 6 = 90 (Very close, but not quite 81)
15 * 5. 4 = 81 (This would be 75, using the 75 unnecessarily)
Since no straightforward combination of these numbers using addition, subtraction, or multiplication directly gives us 81, let's consider the division operation.
60 / 15 = 4
And then:
4 * 75 = 300 (This is too large, so I need to rethink)
If we tweak it slightly:
(39 / 15) * 75 = 26 * 75 (This is clearly wrong)
Now, let's consider an alternative:
(75 - 60) * 39 = 15 * 39 = 585 (Too large)
(75 - 60) * 15 = 15 * 15 = 225 (Still too large)
(60 - 39) * 15 = 21 * 15 = 315 (Still too large)
Considering again:
(39 - 15) * 75 = 24 * 75 (Still too large)
For a better fit:
(75 - 15) * 6 = 60 * 6 = 360 (Still too large)
Finally:
75 - (60 - 15) * 1 = 75 - 45 = 30 (Still too small)
Another last-fall:
(60 * 15) / 39 = 900 / 39 (This is approximately 23 as a decimal)
None of these direct combinations hit 81 exactly.
Let’s directly use the given numbers:
Calculations:
(75 - 39) + (60 / 15) = 36 + 4 = 40 (not 81)
(75 + 39) - (60 - 15) = 114 - 45 = 69 (not 81)
Then then,
(75 + 15) - 39 = 90 - 39 = 51 (not 81)
(60 + 39) - 75 = 99 - 75 = 24 (not 81)
We see, we missed:
(75 + 15) - 39 = 90 - 39 = 51 (Not 81)
Finally:
(75 - 39) + (60 - 15) = 36 + 45 = 81
</think>
<answer>(75 - 39) + (60 - 15)</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll evaluate the given numbers: 60, 15, 75, 39. Our target is to reach 81 using these numbers once, with the use of basic arithmetic operations.
Looking at the numbers, 60 - 39 = 21. This is a useful intermediate result.
Next, to get closer to 81, we need a way to combine 21 with another number. 75 + 21 = 96, but this is too high.
Then, observing 15, it seems we need to find a way to balance this to 81. 81 - 15 = 66. This gives us the last piece.
So, 60 - 39 + 75 - 15 = 81.
</think>
<answer> (60 - 39) + 75 - 15 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to create an equation using the numbers 54, 62, and 68 that equals 60. One way to approach this is to think about which numbers can be combined to get close to 60.
- Subtracting 54 from 62 gives us 8.
- Subtracting this 8 from 68 gives us 60.
This means the numbers 62 and 54, when combined through subtraction, equal 8 less than 60, and adding them to the 68 (which is 8 more than 60) gives us 60.
So we can use: 68 - 62 + 54 = 60.
</think>
<answer> 68 - 62 + 54 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list the numbers we have: 81, 48, and 13. We need to create an equation that equals 46 using each number exactly once.
Let's try combining the numbers in different ways:
- 81 - 48 = 33 (which is not 46)
- 81 - 13 = 68 (which is not 46)
- 48 - 13 = 35 (which is not 46)
- 81 + 48 = 129 (which is not 46)
- 48 + 13 = 61 (which is not 46)
- 81 + 13 = 94 (which is not 46)
None of these combinations work. It seems we need to think of a different approach.
Let's try subtracting:
81 - 48 = 33
Now, we need 13 + some number to equal 46. So, 46 - 33 = 13, which uses all the numbers.
Thus, the equation is: 81 - 48 + 13 = 46.
</think>
<answer> 81 - 48 + 13 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 29, 89, and 94. We need to create an equation that equals 34 using each number exactly once.
- Clearly, 94 is the largest number and likely not what we need for the operation to reach 34. 
- The number 89 is also very close to 94, so subtracting or adding it is not straightforward.
- This leaves us with the number 29. 
- Let's see if we can use 29 in a way that, when combined with another number, gives us 34. 
- If we take 94 - 89 = 5 and then add 29 = 34, we get our desired result.
</think>
<answer> 94 - 89 + 29 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to use the numbers 4, 9, and 17 exactly once to get an equation that equals 12.
We can start by considering the operations we can use:
- Addition: 4 + 9 = 13 or 4 + 17 = 21 or 9 + 17 = 26
- Subtraction: 17 - 4 = 13 or 17 - 9 = 8 or 9 - 4 = 5
- Multiplication: 4 * 9 = 36 or 4 * 17 = 68 or 9 * 17 = 153
- Division: 17 / 4 = 4.25 or 17 / 9 = 1.888... or 9 / 4 = 2.25
None of these straightforward combinations get us to 12. However, we need to consider other possible ways to combine these operations.
Let's try: 17 - 9 - 4 = 4 which is not 12. Instead, let's try: 17 - 9 + 4 = 12
Certainly, this combination works. Therefore, the equation is 17 - 9 + 4 = 12.
</think>
<answer> 17 - 9 + 4 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use the numbers 13, 81, and 8 to make 76. Let's start by looking at the numbers:
- We have 13, which we can add or subtract from other numbers.
- We have 81, which is quite large and could either be subtracted or added.
- We also have 8, which can be used similarly.
If I look at 81 - 13, I get 68, which is close to 76. Now, I just need to get to 8 more. I can do this by subtracting 8 from 81, and that gives me 73. Then, I need to add 3 more to get 76. However, 73 is not the target, so I need to rethink this approach.
Instead, let's try 13 + 81 = 94. This is too high, so I need to subtract more to get to 76. How about 94 - 81 = 13, and then 13 + 8 = 21, which is far from 76. Clearly, I need to revisit my approach.
Now, let's try 81 - 13 = 68, and then we need 9 more to get to 76. This is still not working. Let me try another combination: 81 - 8 = 73, and then add 13 to get 86, which is too high. I need to keep trying.
Finally, I realize that 81 - 13 = 68, and then 68 + 8 = 76, which is perfect.
</think>
<answer> (81 - 13) + 8 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 75, 65, and 43. We need to create an equation that equals 97 using these numbers only once.
We can try different combinations of basic arithmetic operations.
Trying 75 - 65 = 10, which is not 97.
Then, 75 + 65 = 140, which is too large.
Let's try another combination: 75 + 43 = 118, which is also too large.
Now, let's try a combination including subtraction: 75 - 43 = 32. If we add 65 to this result, we get 32 + 65 = 97.
This gives us the equation: 75 - 43 + 65 = 97.
</think>
<answer> (75 - 43) + 65 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 75, 65, and 43. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once and the operations +, -, *, / to get 97.
If we try to use subtraction, we can see that 75 - 65 = 10, which is quite close but not quite 97. Adding or subtracting 43 from 10 doesn't get us to 97.
Now let's try multiplication and division. If we multiply 75 by 43, we get 3225, which is too large. If we divide 75 by 43, we get approximately 1. 74, which is not useful.
Instead, let's consider combining 75 and 65. Their sum is 140. Adding or subtracting 43 from 140 gives us 183 or 97 respectively. To get 97, we use 140 - 43.
So, the equation we can form is (75 + 65) - 43 = 97.
</think>
<answer> (75 + 65) - 43 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 65, 11, and 24. We need to use these numbers with basic arithmetic operations to get to 78.
- Subtracting 11 from 65 gives us 54.
- Now we need an operation that will turn 54 into 78. Adding 24 to 54 does the trick, resulting in 78.
So, the equation is: 65 - 11 + 24 = 78.
</think>
<answer> (65 - 11) + 24 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 23, 51, and 33. We need to create an equation that results in 61 using each of these numbers exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
We can try different combinations:
- Adding them together: 23 + 51 + 33 = 107 (which is not 61)
- Multiplying and subtracting: There doesn't seem to be a combination of these numbers and basic operations that will yield 61.
- Using division: One possibility could be 51 - 23 + 33. Let's check this:
  51 - 23 = 28
  28 + 33 = 61
This equals 61 and uses each number exactly once.
</think>
<answer> 51 - 23 + 33 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to form an equation using the numbers 48, 75, and 72 that equals 50. I'll start by considering the operations available - addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Dividing 75 by 72 gives me a result close to 1.04, and multiplying this by 48 gives me a number quite a bit larger than 50. This doesn't seem promising.
- Multiplying 75 by 72 gives me 5400, which is much too large.
- If I try subtracting 72 from 75, I get 3. Then if I divide 48 by 3, I get 16, which isn't 50.
- Subtracting 48 from 75 gives me 27, and dividing 72 by 27 gives me 2.67, which is still not 50.
- If I add 48 and 72, I get 120. Then, if I subtract 75 from this sum, I get 45. However, I need to reach 50, so I'm still off by 5.
- If I perform these operations in a different order, adding 48 and 75 gives me 123, and then subtracting 72 from 123 gives me 51, which is close but not exactly 50.
- At this point, none of the straightforward combinations are quite right.
- Subtracting some of the numbers might help. From 75 - 48, I get 27. Multiplying this difference (27) by 1.85 (which would give me 50) isn't feasible.
- Multiplying 48 by 1. 111 (approximately 75 / 72) is close to 54, which is close, but not 50.
- Finally, if we use the precise fractional value 75 / 72, multiplied by 48, we get:
  75 / 72 * 48 = 62.5 / 2 = 31.25 / 1 = 50.
</think>
<answer> 75 / 72 * 48 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to create an equation that equals 53 using the numbers 30, 9, and 92 exactly once. 
- Adding 92 and 9 gives us 101, which is too high.
- Subtracting 9 from 92 gives us 83, which is also too high.
- We need to use 30 somewhere since adding it will decrease the result needed to reach 53.
- If we add 30 to 9, we get 39, and then we need 14 more to reach 53.
- We can get 14 by subtracting 9 from 30.
So, the equation works: 92 + 9 - 30 = 51. However, this does not give us the exact 53.
- We are one away from 53. We can get this by adding 9 to 51, but 9 is already used.
- Instead, if we consider another combination like 92 - 30 - 9, we get 53.
</think>
<answer> 92 - 30 - 9 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list the numbers we have: 63, 97, and 83. We need to use these numbers exactly once to get 77.
- We can start by subtracting the smallest number from the largest to see what we get: 97 - 83 = 14.
- Now we need 63 to get to 77, so we can add 14 to 63: 14 + 63 = 77.
This gives us the equation: 97 - 83 + 63 = 77.
</think>
<answer> (97 - 83) + 63 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 25, 85, and 41 that equals 19. Let's start by checking if any of the numbers can give us 19 when used as it is, or if any combination of the numbers with basic arithmetic operations results in 19.
- 41 - 25 = 16 (not 19)
- 85 - 41 = 44 (not 19)
- 25 - 85 = -61 (not 19)
- 85 - 25 = 60 (not 19)
- 41 + 25 = 66 (not 19)
- 25 + 85 = 110 (not 19)
It seems straightforward operations are not helping. Let's consider the possibility of combining numbers or adding more operations:
- 85 / 41 = 2.073 (not 19)
- 25 / 41 = 0.61 (not 19)
Then I might need to add or subtract these intermediate results:
(25 - 41) / 85 = -16 / 85, which is also not 19.
None of the basic operations or simple combinations are producing 19. It appears I am missing some way to manipulate these numbers.
Now let's consider another possibility: using all numbers in a single expression.
Combining all three numbers:
85 - 41 = 44
44 - 25 = 19
This combination works but doesn't follow the rules of using each number once.
Considering another approach without changing the structure:
85 - 25 - 41 = 19
This combination also works but uses the numbers in a different order.
Since I need to use each number only once and maintain the order as given, I might consider a nested expression:
(85 - 41) - 25 = 19
</think>
<answer>(85 - 41) - 25</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 40, 47, and 44. We need to combine these numbers using basic arithmetic operations to get 43.
- One way could be to start by looking at 47 - 44 = 3. Now we need 40 - 3 = 37 to reach our target of 43.
- However, 37 is not equal to 43.
- Let's try another combination: 47 - (44 - 40) = 47 - 4 = 43 which gives us our desired result.
</think>
<answer> 47 - (44 - 40) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list out the numbers we have: 40, 47, and 44. We need to create an equation using these numbers that equals 43.
We can start by looking at the differences between these numbers:
- 47 - 40 = 7
- 44 - 40 = 4
- 47 - 44 = 3
- 44 - 47 = -3
We see that one of the numbers, 3, is very close to 43. If we use 47 - 44 = 3, then we need to do something with 40 and 4 to get to 43.
Adding 40 and 4 gives us 44, and if we subtract this from 47, we get:
(47 - 4) = 43
However, we cannot use 47 twice. So, let's try another combination.
Another combination to consider is (40 - 4) + 47, but that doesn't give us 43.
We can also consider (47 - 4) - 40, but that gives us 3.
The correct combination seems to be:
(47 - 44) + 40 / 4
But we know 40 / 4 is 10, and then (47 - 44) is 3, so it's not right.
After reviewing all options, the correct equation seems to be:
(47 - 44) * (40 / 4)
Breaking it down:
- 47 - 44 = 3
- 40 / 4 = 10
- 3 * 10 = 30
This also doesn't work. We need to reconsider simpler combinations.
If we try (40 + 4) - 47, we get 14 - 47 = -33, which isn't 43.
We missed the correct approach:
If we take 47 - (44 - 40) = 47 - 4 = 43
This means the equation is (47 - (44 - 40)) = 43.
This works as 44 - 40 gives 4, and 47 - 4 equals 43.
</think>
<answer> (47 - (44 - 40)) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 40, 47, and 44. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once, resulting in 43.
One approach is to check if combining any two numbers gives us a result that, when combined with the third, equals 43.
If we take 47 - 44 = 3, then we would need 40 - 3 = 37 to make 43, which doesn't work.
Next, consider 47 - 40 = 7, and then 7 + 44 = 51, which isn't 43.
47 - 44 = 3, and then 40 + 3 = 43, which gives us our result.
So the equation is 47 - 44 + 40 = 43.
</think>
<answer> 47 - 44 + 40 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 40, 47, and 44. We need to use each exactly once along with basic arithmetic operations to get the result 43.
Looking at the numbers, we can notice that 47 - 44 = 3. This gives us a value of 3 that we can use.
Now, we need to use the remaining numbers (40 and 3) to get to 43. It seems adding or subtracting 40 from 3 or 43 doesn't work, so let's try multiplication or division.
Multiplying 40 by 3 gives 120, which is too high, and dividing 43 by 40 gives a decimal which isn't useful here.
However, if we subtract 40 from 47 (which we already got as 3) and then add the result to 44, we get:
(47 - 40) + 44 = 7 + 44 = 51, which is not 43.
Further, if we try (47 - 44) + 40, we get:
3 + 40 = 43, which is our desired result.
So the correct combination is 47 - 44 + 40, giving us 43.
</think>
<answer>(47 - 44) + 40</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 22, 6, and 8. We need to create an equation that equals 24 using these numbers exactly once.
One effective approach is to look for a number that we can manipulate with the others to reach 24. Notice that 24 - 8 = 16. Now we need to make 16 using 22 and 6.
If we calculate 22 - 6, we get 16.
So, now we can create the equation: 22 - 6 + 8 = 24.
Let's verify this:
1. Start with 22.
2. Subtract 6: 22 - 6 = 16.
3. Add 8: 16 + 8 = 24.
This confirms that the equation 22 - 6 + 8 indeed equals 24.
</think>
<answer> 22 - 6 + 8 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list out the numbers we have: 99, 40, and 93. We need to use these numbers once each to get an equation that equals 34. 
We can start by subtracting the smaller numbers from the larger ones to see if it gets us closer to 34.
99 - 40 = 59
We are off by 24 from 34.
Now, subtracting 93 from 99 gave us 6, and adding this 6 to 34 would give us 38. But we need to get exactly 34.
Instead, let's try another combination: subtract the larger number 99 from the sum of the other two numbers.
99 - (40 + 93) = 99 - 133 = -34.
This is way off. 
Let's try another approach: Adding 40 and 93 and then subtracting 99.
93 + 40 - 99 = 133 - 99 = 34.
This gives us the number 34, which is what we need.
</think>
<answer> 93 + 40 - 99 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list the numbers we have: 6, 29, and 83. We need to create an equation that equals 60 using these numbers only once, and we can use the basic arithmetic operations.
We need to think about combining these numbers to get close to 60.
One option could be: 83 - 29 = 54. Now, we need to get to 60 from 54 using the remaining number 6.
We can do: 54 + 6 = 60.
So, the equation is 83 - 29 + 6 = 60.
</think>
<answer> 83 - 29 + 6 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's examine the numbers we have: 13, 52, and 38. We need to combine these to get 77 using basic arithmetic operations. 
Checking the operations, adding or subtracting the largest number (52) or the smallest number (13) from the middle number (38) does not yield 77. Subtracting 13 from 38 gives 25, and adding 52 gives 67, which is too low. Adding 52 to 38 gives 90, which is too high.
Now, let's consider multiplying smaller numbers and adding the rest. Multiplying 13 by 52 gives a very large number - 676, so this is not useful. Dividing 52 by 13 gives exactly 4, which when added to 38 gives 42, still far from 77.
We could try a combination like 52 - 38 + 13, but this equals 33, not 77.
Finally, let's consider another combination: subtracting 38 from 52 and then adding 13. This gives us:
52 - 38 = 14
14 + 13 = 27, which is still not 77.
Lastly, let's consider 38 + 52 - 13: This indeed equals 77.
</think>
<answer> (38 + 52) - 13 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list what we have: 48, 2, and 26. We need to create an equation that equals 11 using these numbers only once.
- If we add 48 and 2, we get 50, which is too high.
- If we subtract 48 from 26, we get -20, which is also too high.
- If we subtract 26 from 2, we get -24, which is even higher in absolute value.
- Subtracting 2 from 48 gives us 46, and if we subtract 26 from 46, we get 20.
- Now, 46 - 26 - 2 = 18, which is close but not exactly 11.
- Subtracting 2 from 46 and then dividing by 26 gives us: (46 - 2) / 26 = 44 / 26, which is not 11.
- Now, let's try: 48 - 26 + 2 = 22 - 26 = -4, which is incorrect.
- Let's reverse this: 48 - (26 + 2). This equals 48 - 28 = 20, which is not 11.
- Another attempt: 48 - 26 / 2 = 48 - 13 = 35, which is too high.
- Let's try (48 + 2) / 26 = 50 / 26, which is not 11.
- Now, let's do: 48 - 26 + 2 / 2. This equals 48 - 26 + 1 = 23 - 26 = -3, which is incorrect.
- After considering multiple combinations, let's try: (48 - 26) / 2 = 22 / 2 = 11.
So, we have found that the equation that works is (48 - 26) / 2.
</think>
<answer> (48 - 26) / 2 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 74, 9, and 21. We need to use these in an equation that results in 62.
- Adding or subtracting these numbers individually from or to each other won't get us close to 62.
- Multiplying 74 by 9 gives us 666, which is far too high.
- Multiplying 74 by 21 gives us 1554, which is also way too high.
- If we try 21 * 9 = 189 and then subtract 74 from 189, we get 115, which is still too high.
- Let's try subtracting 74 from 9: -65. Not helpful.
- Now, let's try subtracting 21 from 9 first: -12, then adding 74 to this -12: 74 - 12 = 62. This gives us the right result.
So, the equation would be 9 - 21 + 74 = 62.
</think>
<answer> 9 - 21 + 74 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list the numbers we have: 30, 45, and 54. We need to create an equation that equals 21 using each number exactly once.
We can start by subtracting the smaller numbers from the larger ones to see if we get closer to 21. 
54 - 30 = 24
We're close to 21, but we need a smaller result. Now let's consider 45 - (54 - 30).
Let's calculate that: 45 - 14 = 31, which is not 21.
Instead, let's try 30 + (45 - 54).
Let's calculate that: 30 + (-9) is not valid as we don't have negative numbers directly available.
We should instead look at other combinations, such as: 54 - 45 + 30.
Let's calculate that: 9 + 30 = 39, which is not 21.
Another approach would be: 45 - (54 - 30).
Let's calculate that: 45 - 14 = 31, which is not 21.
Another way to consider: 30 + 45 - 54.
Let's calculate that: 75 - 54 = 21.
So, we get the equation: 30 + 45 - 54 = 21.
</think>
<answer> 30 + 45 - 54 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 16, 48, 30. We need to create an equation that equals 27 using each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
We can try different combinations:
- Adding, subtracting, or multiplying these numbers won't easily reach 27.
- Considering division as it could potentially lower the number, let's try dividing smaller numbers by larger ones.
If we divide 30 by 48, we get 0.625, which is not helpful.
Then let's try dividing 48 by 16, which equals 3. If we use 30 - 3 we get 27, which is the desired result.
So, the equation is 30 - (48 / 16) = 27.
</think>
<answer> 30 - (48 / 16) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 17, 66, 56, and 68. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once that equals 37.
We can start by trying to add and subtract these numbers to see if we can get close to 37.
Combining 56 and 17 gives us 73.
Now, subtracting 66 from 73 gives us 73 - 66 = 7.
We're far from 37, so let's try different combinations.
68 - 56 = 12
Now we have 17, 12 left.
17 + 12 = 29.
We're still not at 37.
If we try 68 - 17, we get 51.
We need to use 12 but not in its current form.
Let's try 68 - 17 - 56 + 12:
68 - 17 = 51
51 - 56 = -5
-5 + 12 = 7 (not helping us).
Now let's try 68 - 17 - 56 - 12:
68 - 17 = 51
51 - 56 = -5
-5 - 12 = -17 (not helping).
Another way to look at it:
Notice that 68 - 56 = 12, but we need to include 17 into our sum somehow.
Let's try using multiplication and division:
68 - 56 = 12
12 + (66 ÷ 17) doesn't work as 66 ÷ 17 doesn't give an integer.
Now noticing a different approach:
12 + (66 - 56 - 17) = 12 + 3 = 15.
We still need 22 more to reach 37.
One final check:
(68 - 56) + (66 - 17) = 12 + 49 = 61.
None of the above combinations work so far.
We need to think again:
(66 + 56 - 68 - 17) = 25 - 17 = 8.
(66 + 56 - 68) - 17 = 54 - 17 = 37.
</think>
<answer> (66 + 56 - 68) - 17 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list the numbers we have: 67, 10, and 15. We need to create an equation using these numbers that equals 42. The operations we can use are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
- If we try to add or subtract, it won't work as both 67 + 10 + 15 = 92 and 67 - 10 - 15 = 42. However, we're only allowed to use each number once.
- If we try multiplication or division, we need to think if there's a way to get 42 using 67, 10, and 15.
- We notice that 67 - 15 = 52, which is close to 42. Then we need to subtract enough from 52 to get to 42, which is 52 - 10 = 42.
Therefore, the equation is 67 - 15 - 10 = 42.
</think>
<answer> (67 - 15) - 10 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 57, 77, and 6 that equals 14. I should consider all possible combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Division of 57 by 6 gives 9.5, which isn't close to 14.
- Multiplication of any two of the numbers doesn't result in 14.
- Subtraction of any two numbers from the third or each other also doesn't yield 14.
Considering these, I think about combining them in a different way. However, 77 - 60 equals 17, which is too high, and 77 - 51 (50 - 6) also gives a result that is too high. 
Now, let's try 57 - 6 = 51, and then try to subtract something to get to 14. 77 - 57 = 20. Then, 20 - 6 = 14, which works.
</think>
<answer> 77 - 57 - 6 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers: 34, 93, 29, and 14. Our goal is to create an equation that equals 84 using each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
Let's start by checking if we can get close to 84 with addition or subtraction:
- 93 + 29 = 122
- 93 + 14 = 107
- 93 + 34 = 127
- 34 + 29 = 63
- 34 + 14 = 48
- 29 + 14 = 43
We can see that 93 + 29 = 122 is the closest, but it's too high. Now let's try multiplication and division:
- 34 * 29 = 986 (way off)
- 93 * 14 = 1302 (way off)
- 29 * 14 = 406 (way off)
- 34 * 14 = 476 (way off)
None of these direct combinations seem to work. Let's try a different approach combining operations:
- 93 - 29 = 64
- Now we need 20 more to make 84
- 34 - 14 = 20
So, we can use: 93 - 29 + 34 - 14 = 84
</think>
<answer> 93 - 29 + 34 - 14 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 89, 35, and 61. We need to use these once each to get a result of 63.
We should start by considering the largest numbers first because they can significantly affect the outcome. Subtracting 35 from 89 gives us 54.
Next, we need to get from 54 to 63, so we need an additional 9. We can see that 61 - 35 = 26, and we need to find a way to get to 9 from 26.
Breaking down 26, we see that 26 - 17 = 9, but 17 is not in our pool of numbers. However, 89 - 61 = 28, and then 28 - 19 = 9, but again, 19 is not in our numbers.
Instead, let's try adding and subtracting different combinations:
89 + 61 - 35 = 115 - 35 = 80, which is too high.
89 + 35 - 61 = 124 - 61 = 63, which is the correct answer.
So, we can use 89 + 35 - 61 to get 63.
</think>
<answer> 89 + 35 - 61 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 89, 35, and 61. We need to use these in a way that results in 63, using each number only once.
- One way to approach this is to see if we can approach 63 by adding or subtracting some of these numbers.
- If we subtract 35 from 89, we get 54.
- Now, if we subtract 61 from 54, we get -7, which is not 63.
- Instead, let's try adding 35 and 61: 35 + 61 = 96.
- Now if we subtract 35 from 96, we get 61, which isn't 63 either.
- We seem to be missing 9 or 27 to reach 63. If we take 35 and subtract 12 (which is 35 - 23), we try to see if we can make up the difference by using 61 in some operation.
- Actually, 61 - 35 equals 26, but we need 9.
- Instead of 89 - 35, let's try 89 - 61 + 35. Calculating this we get 89 - 61 = 28, and then 28 + 35 = 63.
</think>
<answer> (89 - 61) + 35 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers available: 99, 66, and 80.
We need to create an expression using these numbers exactly once that equals 85.
We can start by looking at the larger numbers, 99 and 80, and see what we can do with them.
99 - 14 = 85 could work, but 14 isn't in our list. That means we might need to find a way to make 14 using 66 and 80.
Let's try some combinations:
66 + 80 = 145 (too big)
66 - 80 = -14 (not positive, not what we're looking for)
80 - 66 = 14 (this works, so we have a way to make 14)
Therefore, with 80 - 66 = 14, we can create the equation: 99 - (80 - 66) = 99 - 14 = 85.
</think>
<answer> 99 - (80 - 66) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers 99, 66, and 80. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once to get a result of 85.
We can start by looking at the numbers. 99 - 66 equals 33, which is close to 85 but not quite there. Adding or subtracting 80 from 33 or 85 doesn't help.
We could multiply 33 by some number close to 2.5 to get near 85. 33 * 2.5 = 82.5, not quite 85.
Now, let's try a mix. If we take 99 and subtract 80, we get 19. We need to add 66 to 19 to get 85. This gives us: 99 - 80 + 66 = 85.
</think>
<answer> 99 - 80 + 66 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers available: 56, 65, and 5. We need to form an equation that equals 14 using each number only once.
One way to approach this is to consider simple operations like addition and subtraction to see if we can get close to 14.
Adding 56 and 5 gives us 61. Subtracting 65 from 61 would give us -4, which is not 14.
If we subtract 56 from 65, we get 9. Then if we add 5, we get 14.
So, the equation is: 65 - 56 + 5 = 14.
</think>
<answer> 65 - 56 + 5 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list out the numbers we have: 56, 65, and 5. We need to create an equation that equals 14 using all the numbers exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
- Multiplication and division can give us larger numbers quickly, so let's try to use addition and subtraction first.
- We can start by looking at 65 and 5. Their sum is 70, which is too large. Dividing or subtracting a larger number from a smaller one gives us 50 or less, which is also not suitable.
- Now let's consider the number 56 and 5. Their difference is 51, which is also not suitable.
- Finally, the only combination left is 65 - 56 = 9. Now we need to get from 9 to 14 using the remaining number 5.
- Subtracting 5 from 9 gives us 4. We still need 10 more to reach 14.
- Finally, adding 5 to 4 gives us 9, and then adding another 5 gives us 14.
So the equation is 65 - 56 + 5 = 14.
</think>
<answer> 65 - 56 + 5 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list out our numbers: 45, 52, 50, 21. We need to combine these to get 26.
One way to approach this is to try different combinations of operations.
If we look at 52 - 50 = 2, and then try to use that along with the other numbers to reach 26.
So, 52 - 50 = 2. Now we need 24 more to reach 26. We can get 24 from 45 - 21 = 24.
So the equation could be: (52 - 50) + (45 - 21) = 2 + 24.
Let's check if we can simplify it further and if it equals 26. Indeed, 2 + 24 = 26.
</think>
<answer> (52 - 50) + (45 - 21) </answer>

<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 4, 11, and 19. We need to form an equation that uses each number exactly once and results in 26.
We need to try different combinations with basic operations:
1. 19 - 4 = 15, and 15 + 11 = 26. This gives us an equation: 19 - 4 + 11 = 26.
2. Checking the other combinations to ensure this is the only possible solution:
   - 4 + 11 + 19 = 34, which is not equal to 26.
   - 4 * 11 + 19 = 63, which is also not equal to 26.
Thus, the combination 19 - 4 + 11 equals 26 and uses each number exactly once.
</think>
<answer> 19 - 4 + 11 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 4, 11, and 19. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 26.
- One approach is to try combining the numbers in ways that will add up to 26 when combined with arithmetic operations. 
- We can start by looking at the sum of the largest number (19) and the next largest number (11), which equals 30. However, we need 26, so we need to subtract something to reach this number.
- If we consider subtracting the smallest number (4) from this sum, we get: 30 - 4 = 26.
- Therefore, the equation that satisfies this condition is (19 + 11) - 4 = 26.
</think>
<answer> (19 + 11) - 4 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 16, 66, and 24. We need to create an equation that equals 58 using each number exactly once.
- If we subtract 24 from 66, we get 42, which is close to 58.
- If we add 16 to 42, we get 58, which is exactly what we need.
Therefore, the equation is: 66 - 24 + 16 = 58.
</think>
<answer> 66 - 24 + 16 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 16, 66, and 24. We need to combine these using basic arithmetic operations to get 58.
- Let's start with the larger numbers and try combinations:
  - 66 - 16 = 50
  - Now we need 8 more to reach 58, and we have 24 left. 50 + 24 = 74, which is too large.
  - Let's try another combination:
  - 66 - 24 = 42
  - Now we need 16 more to reach 58, and we have 16 left. 42 + 16 = 58.
  - This gives us our target.
</think>
<answer> (66 - 24) + 16 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 26, 10, and 13 to equal 49. Let's start by looking at the numbers and considering what operations might work:
- If I add 26 and 13, I get 39.
- If I add 10 to 39, I get 49. This seems promising.
- Therefore, the equation is 26 + 13 + 10 = 49.
</think>
<answer> (26 + 13) + 10 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's break down the numbers we have: 33, 40, and 77. We need an equation that equals 84 using each of these numbers exactly once.
One approach is to consider if the sum or difference of the numbers can get us close to 84.
33 + 40 = 73, which is close to 84, but slightly below. If we add 77, we get:
73 + 77 = 150, which is too high.
Now, let's try another combination: 
77 - 40 = 37, and adding 33:
37 + 33 = 70, which is still not 84.
Perhaps we should try subtraction and addition in a different order:
77 - 33 = 44, and then add 40:
44 + 40 = 84, which is exactly what we need.
</think>
<answer> (77 - 33) + 40 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 9, 53, 69, and 21. We need to use these numbers once each to make the equation equal 28.
Looking at the numbers, 53 seems quite large and would be challenging to modify to get close to 28. 69 is also large and would only increase the sum when combined with smaller numbers like 21 and 9. 21 is the smallest and thus a potential candidate for manipulation.
Let's try combining 21 and 9: 21 + 9 = 30. Now we need to adjust this to get to 28. We could subtract 2 (which we can get from 69 - 67, but that's not possible with given numbers), but a simpler option is to subtract 2 from 30 directly, but that's not available.
Now, let's try 69 - 53 = 16. This is closer to 28, but it's still off by 12. We can get 12 by subtracting 9 from another number (21 or 69), but we've already used one 9 and it's not available directly.
Another way to look at it is using the inverse of 69 - 53 = 16 to get closer to 28, which can be 28 = 69 - 41. But we only have 53, and we cannot create 41 using 9 and 21.
Let's try a different combination: 69 - 21 = 48. Now we need to get from 48 to 28, which is 20 less. We can't get 20 with the left numbers (9 and 53). 
The best way seems to be using subtraction: 69 - 41 = 28. We know 41 = 53 - 12. To get 12 from the remaining numbers, we could use 21 - 9 = 12. So the equation becomes: 69 - (53 - (21 - 9)) = 69 - (53 - 21) + 9 = 69 - 32 + 9 = 48 - 32 + 9 = 16 + 9 = 25 + 3 = 28.
This is close, but not quite there. Revisiting, 69 - 53 = 16, and 21 - 53/69 gives no simple form. Let's try differently: 69 - 53 = 16. 21 - 9 = 12, and 16 + 12 = 28.
</think>
<answer> (69 - 53) + (21 - 9) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 43, 38, and 21. We need to use these numbers exactly once and only basic arithmetic operations to get a result of 60.
- Adding or subtracting these directly won't get us close to 60.
- Let's try combining them using multiplication and addition:
  43 + 38 = 81
  81 - 21 = 60
This way, we can use all three numbers exactly once and get the result of 60.
</think>
<answer> (43 + 38) - 21 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 96, 41, and 50. We need to use each exactly once to get a result of 87.
- If we add 96 and 41, we get 137, which is too high.
- If we subtract 41 from 96, we get 55, and then adding 50 doesn't quite work to reach 87.
- However, if we subtract 41 from 96 and then add 50, we have: 96 - 41 + 50 = 105, which is still too high.
- Let's consider if we can use multiplication or division to adjust the result. Multiplying and dividing by these numbers won't help us reach 87 either.
- Therefore, we need to re-evaluate and consider the operations differently. Subtracting 50 from 96 first gives us 46, and then adding 41 results in 87.
This seems to work: 96 - 50 + 41 = 87.
</think>
<answer> 96 - 50 + 41 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 81, 92, 74, and 26. We need to create an expression that equals 73 using each number only once. 
Looking at the numbers, 92 - 74 = 18 is a large difference that might help reduce the value. If combined with other numbers appropriately, we might get closer to 73.
Using 81 - 18 = 63, we are still not there. 
Now, considering 26, subtracting 18 leaves us with 8. So, we can use 81 - 92 + 26 - 74 does not get us there.
If we try a different order: 
81 + 26 - 74 - 92 = -59.
Now let's try another order: 
92 - 74 - 26 + 81 = 73.
This looks promising as it uses each number exactly once and equals 73.
</think>
<answer> 92 - 74 - 26 + 81 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers provided: 45, 9, and 24. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to achieve a result of 30.
A good starting point could be to see if we can use subtraction or division to get a more manageable number.
If we subtract 24 from 45, we get 21. Now we have 21 - 9, which equals 21 - 9 = 12.
So far we have 12 from our operation. Now we need another operation to reach 30. We know we need 12 + 18 to get 30.
However, we only have one number left (9) and we can use the remaining 21 (45 - 24) to add to 12.
Therefore, 21 + 9 = 30.
</think>
<answer> (45 - 24) + 9 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 51 using the numbers 87, 79, and 43 exactly once. I can start by checking if I can combine them in any way to get close to 51.
87 + 79 = 166 (too large)
87 + 43 = 130 (still too large)
79 + 43 = 122 (still too large)
87 - 43 = 44 (still not 51)
79 - 43 = 36 (still not 51)
If I combine the operations, I could try:
(87 - 79) * 43, but 79 - 87 = -9 which gives -382 when multiplied by 43, too large.
(87 - 43) * 79, but 87 - 43 = 44 which gives 3478, too large.
Then I try another combination:
79 - (87 - 43) = 79 - 44 = 35 (still not 51)
Perhaps a combination with division could work:
79 - (87 / 43) = 79 - 2 = 77 (still not 51)
Finally, I get:
87 - 79 + 43 = 87 + 43 - 79 = 130 - 79 = 51
So the equation is 87 - 79 + 43 = 51.
</think>
<answer> 87 - 79 + 43 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's examine the numbers we have: 56, 83, 2, and 45. Our goal is to form an equation using these numbers only once that equals 92.
- We start by identifying if any of these numbers are close to 92. The nearest one is 83, which is 19 less than 92.
- We also see that 56 + 2 gives us 58, which is 34 less than 92.
- This suggests we need to get an additional 54 from the remaining numbers (45) to reach 92.
- Adding 45 to 56 gives us 101, which is too large, and subtracting 45 from 56 gives us 11, which is not helpful.
- Instead, let's see if we can add or subtract 45 in a way that helps us reach the target. Removing 45 from 56 gives us 11, which we already know is not helpful.
- Finally, let's consider the equation \(83 - 56 + 45 - 2 \).
- Calculating step by step: 
  - \(83 - 56 = 27\)
  - \(45 + 27 = 72\)
  - \(72 - 2 = 70\)
  - But this does not give us 92. 
- Given that 83 is our best candidate, let's try a different approach: \(83 + 56 - 45 - 2\).
- Calculating step by step: 
  - \(83 + 56 = 139\)
  - \(139 - 45 = 94\)
  - \(94 - 2 = 92\)
- This gives us the correct result of 92.
</think>
<answer> 83 + 56 - 45 - 2 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 94, 4, and 91. We need to use these to get to 12 using basic arithmetic operations. 
94 - 91 = 3 is a possible intermediate result, but it's not 12.
Now, let's try multiplying and subtracting: (94 - 91) * 4 = 3 * 4 = 12.
This gives us the answer 12 using all the numbers exactly once.
</think>
<answer> (94 - 91) * 4 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list the numbers available: 36, 33, and 46. We need to get to 49 using these numbers with basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by looking at the target number, 49.
Adding or subtracting the smallest or largest number (33 or 46) from 36 does not get us close to 49.
Adding 33 to 36 gives 72 which is too high. Subtracting 36 from 33 gives -3 which is not useful.
Subtracting 46 from 36 gives -10 which is not helpful.
Let's consider multiplication and division. 36 * 33 equals 1188, which is far from 49. 46 * 33 = 1518 too. Neither multiplication gives us 49.
So, let's try dividing. 36 / 33 is approximately 1. 09, and 46 / 36 is approximately 1. 28, neither of which help to get 49.
Given the above, let's try some combinations with subtraction and addition:
36 + 33 = 69 (which is too high)
36 + 33 - 46 = 23 (which is close but low)
36 - 33 = 3 (which is too low)
Let's try 36 + 33 / 36: This would be 36 + 1 = 37 (which is still too low). This seems wrong as it doesn't approach 49.
Trying 36 + 33 / 46 = 36 + 0.717 (which rounds to 36. 717, still too low)
The best simple approach seems right to me is 36 + 33 - 46 which gives us 33, which is close but lower than 49. If we consider alternative operations, we could see 36 + (33 - 46) = 33.
So, let's fix the equation a bit further.
Let's review: 33 (from 36 + 33 - 46) is slightly off. However, let's simplify it more:
Instead, 36 - (33 - 46) = 36 - (-13) = 49, exactly as we require.
</think>
<answer> 36 - (33 - 46) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 62, 99, and 52 exactly once, and results in 89.
I'll start by looking at the numbers:
62 + 99 = 161
62 - 99 = -37
62 * 99 = 6198
52 + 62 = 114
52 + 99 = 151
52 - 62 = -10
52 - 99 = -47
None of these combinations directly give me 89.
Now let's consider using the division:
99 / 52 = 1. 8923 (not an integer, can't be used)
62 / 52 = 1. 2 (can't be used as it's not 89)
Then I think about the combination:
99 - 62 = 37
37 + 52 = 89
This combination works.
</think>
<answer> 99 - 62 + 52 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to create an equation using the numbers 28, 1, and 78 that results in 49. Let's start by considering the possible operations we can use: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
- Using 1 in any operation won't change the other numbers in a significant way, so let's focus on 28 and 78.
- If we use multiplication with 28 and 78, we get 28 * 78 = 2188, which is too large.
- If we divide 78 by 28, we get 78 / 28 = 2.7857, which is not close to 49.
- Now, let's consider 28 - 78 = -50, which is far from 49.
- Finally, let's try 78 - 28 = 50. This is still not 49, but it gives us closer to 49 if we adjust.
- We can use 1 in the equation. If we subtract 1 from 50, we get 50 - 1 = 49.
</think>
<answer> (78 - 28) - 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers 4, 20, and 61. We need to use these numbers exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 77.
We can approach this by trying different combinations. Let's look at the operations we have:
- Addition: +
- Subtraction: -
- Multiplication: *
- Division: /

One way to start is to try combining 20 and 61 first since they are quite different. Doing 61 - 20 gives us 41. Now we need 36 more to reach 77 (77 - 41 = 36). We have 4 left, and 41 + 4 = 45, which is close but not quite 36. However, 41 - 4 = 37, and if we subtract one more 4, we get 37 - 4 = 33, which is indeed 36. So, 41 - 4 - 4 = 33, but to get 36, we would need -3, which is not one of our numbers. Instead, let's try another combination.
We know 61 - 20 = 41. Now, if we add 4 to 41, we get 45, which is close but not 77. If we try subtracting 4 from 41, we get 37. To reach 77, we need 40 more. We can get 40 from subtracting 4 from 44, but since 44 is not one of our numbers, we need to think of another way.
Let's try 20 + 61 = 81, and then subtract 20 - 4 = 16, and finally 81 - 16 = 65. We need 12 more to make 77, and 65 - 47 = 18 is too high. Instead, we should use 20 - 4 = 16, so 81 - 16 = 65, and then we need 12 more, so 65 - 53 = 12. However, 53 is not one of our numbers.
Now, let's try 61 + 4 = 65, and then add 20 - 4 = 16, so 65 + 16 = 81, and we need 9 more, so 81 - 72 = 9. But 72 is not one of our numbers.
Finally, we can try 61 - 20 = 41, and then add 4 + 4 = 8, and we need 67 more, but 67 is not possible with our numbers. Let's try 61 + 4 = 65, and then subtract 20 - 4 = 16, and we need 61 more, but we can use 20 - 4 = 16 and add it to 61 to get 77. So, 61 + (20 - 4) = 77.
</think>
<answer> 61 + (20 - 4) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 3, 21, 53, and 10. We need to use these numbers exactly once and combine them using arithmetic operations to get 87.
One way to approach this is to look for a combination that might add up to a significant number close to 87. We see that:
21 + 53 = 74
This is close to 87. If we add the other two numbers, 3 + 10, we get 13. Adding 13 to 74 gives us:
74 + 13 = 87
So, the equation is 21 + 53 + 3 + 10 = 87.
</think>
<answer> 21 + 53 + 3 + 10 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 90, 22, and 19 that equals 30. I'll try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- 90 - 22 - 19 = 49 (This is too high)
- 90 - 22 + 19 = 87 (This is also too high)
- 90 + 22 - 19 = 93 (This is too high as well)
- If I take 90 + 22 = 112 and then subtract 19, I get 93 again, so this doesn't help.
- What if I consider 90 + 19 = 109, then subtract 22: 109 - 22 = 87, still too high.
- Let me try 90 - (22 + 19) = 49 (Already tried this above).
- Finally, if I start with 22 + 19 = 41, and then take 90 - 41 = 49, it's still not 30.
- What if I reevaluate: 90 - (22 + 19 / 2) = 90 - (22 + 9. 5) = 90 - 31. 5 = 58. 5 (This seems too high again).
- Let's try a different approach: (90 - 19) / 22 = 71 / 22 = 3. 2727 (Too low).
- It seems none of the combinations work directly, so let's try another method: 90 / (22 - 19) = 90 / 3 = 30. This works.
</think>
<answer> 90 / (22 - 19) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to use the numbers 69, 31, and 93 exactly once to get 55. Let's consider the operations we can use: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
- If I use 93, it's quite large and moving away from 55, so I should probably subtract or divide by smaller numbers.
- Subtracting 31 from 93 would give me 62, which is too high.
- Subtracting 69 from 93 would give me 24, which also seems too low.
- Multiplying and dividing these numbers in various ways won't reach 55.
- Therefore, I should consider adding some numbers and subtracting others.
Let's try 93 - 69 + 31. This gives us 93 - 69 = 24, and then 24 + 31 = 55.
</think>
<answer> 93 - 69 + 31 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 33, 59, and 61. We need to create an equation that equals 87 using each of these numbers exactly once.
We can start by looking at the parts of 87 that we can form from the numbers we have:
- 87 - 61 = 26
- 87 - 59 = 28
- 33 + 59 = 92
We see that 26 or 28 don't involve all the given numbers, but 92 does include 61. This leaves 33 and 59. We need to make 92 - 33 or 92 - 59 to get 87. 
92 - 59 = 33 and 87 - 33 = 54, which involves the remaining number 33. But this isn't right. 
Now, let's try a combination:
(61 + 59) - 33 = 120 - 33 = 87
This gives us the correct result, using each number only once.
</think>
<answer> (61 + 59) - 33 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to consider the equation that will likely yield 49 when we use the numbers 34, 13, and 2 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
- 34 - 13 = 21, and we still need an additional 28 to reach 49. Adding 2 to 21 doesn't work.
- 34 + 13 = 47, and we are still short of 2 to reach 49. Adding 2 gives us 50, which is too high.
- Using 34 - (13 + 2) = 34 - 15 = 19, which is too low.
- Now, let's try: 34 + 13 = 47, and then 47 + 2 = 49. This seems promising.
</think>
<answer> (34 + 13) + 2 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll start by looking at the target number we want to reach, which is 86. We are given three numbers: 89, 41, and 38. One way to get close to 86 is to use subtraction or addition.
- If I subtract 38 from 89, I get 51, which is already too high.
- Subtracting 41 from 89 gives 48, which is too low.
- Adding 41 to 38 is 79, which is still not 86.
- If I subtract 41 from 89, I get 48, and then I need to get from 48 to 86. I can do this by adding 38 to 48, as 38 + 48 = 86.
Therefore, my equation is (89 - 41) + 38 = 86.
</think>
<answer> (89 - 41) + 38 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 69, 1, and 81. We need to create an equation that equals 13 using each of these numbers exactly once.
We can start by considering simple operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Let's try different combinations. One possibility is to subtract 69 from 81 and then add 1:
81 - 69 + 1 = 12
This gives us 12, not 13. We need to adjust.
Now let's try subtracting 1 from 69 and then adding that to 81:
81 + 69 - 1 = 148
This is much too high.
Let's try another combination: adding 1 to 69 and then subtracting 81:
69 + 1 - 81 = -11
This is too low.
Let's try one more possibility: adding 1 and 81 and then subtracting 69:
(1 + 81) - 69 = 82 - 69 = 13
Now we get the required result of 13.
</think>
<answer> (1 + 81) - 69 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers available: 46, 10, and 43. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once, combining them with basic arithmetic operations to equal 79.
- Adding and subtracting the numbers directly do not get us to 79.
- Multiplying the largest number (46) by the next (43) gives us 1976, far from 79.
- We should try combining 46 and 10 or 43 with the other two numbers.
- If we subtract 43 from 46, we get 3. Adding this to 10 gives us 13.
- Then, we need 66 more to reach 79 (79 - 13 = 66).
- 43 * 1. 561799385 (approximately) doesn't use whole numbers, so this isn't viable.
- Instead, let's try other combinations: 46 + 10 + 43 = 99, which is too high, and 46 - 10 + 43 = 79, which is what we need.
Therefore, the equation using 46, 10, and 43 to equal 79 is 46 - 10 + 43.
</think>
<answer> 46 - 10 + 43 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using 95, 76, and 19 that equals 38. Let's start by looking at the numbers:
- 95 - 76 = 19
- 95 - 19 = 76
- 76 - 19 = 57
- 76 + 19 = 95
- 95 + 76 = 171
- 76 + 95 = 171
None of these immediate combinations give us 38. Let's also consider operations between the numbers:
- (95 - 76) / 19 = 8 / 19 (not 38)
- (95 - 19) / 76 = 76 / 76 = 1 (not 38)
- (95 + 76) / 19 = 171 / 19 = 9 (not 38)
- (76 - 19) + 95 = 57 + 95 = 152 (not 38)
Let's try a different approach by adding or subtracting in a different order:
- (76 - 19) + (95 - 76) = 57 + 19 = 76 (not 38)
- (95 - 19) - (76 - 95) = 76 - 19 = 57 (not 38)
- 19 + (95 - 76) = 19 + 19 = 38 (This works)
We have found that (19 + (95 - 76)) = 38.
</think>
<answer> 19 + (95 - 76) </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to create an equation using the numbers 57, 40, and 92 that equals 75. One approach is to consider the differences, sums, or products that might lead us to our target number.
Looking at the numbers, we can see:
92 - 57 = 35
Now, we need to get from 35 to 75. We can do this by adding 40 to 35.
So, 35 + 40 = 75.
Therefore, the equation is 92 - 57 + 40 = 75.
</think>
<answer> (92 - 57) + 40 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 33, 86, and 22. We need to create an equation using these numbers once each to equal 31.
We can try different combinations of the basic arithmetic operations. Let's start with subtraction:
- If we subtract 22 from 33, we get 11.
- If we subtract 11 from 86, we get 75, which is too high.
- Let's try another combination: subtracting 22 from 86 gives us 64.
- Then we need to subtract 11 (33 - 22) from 64: 64 - 11 = 53, which is still not 31.
Let's try another combination: 
- Subtract 22 from 33 gives us 11.
- Adding 65 (86 - 22) to 11 gives us 76, which is too high.
Now, let's try multiplication and addition:
- Multiplying 33 by 22 gives us 726.
- This is clearly too high, so let's try other combinations.
Finally, let's try:
- Subtract 22 from 86 to get 64.
- Then we need to subtract 33 from 64 to get 31.
This gives us the equation: 64 - 33 = 31.
</think>
<answer> (86 - 22) - 33 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 80, 28, and 47. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to equal 61.
Let's try combining 80 and 47 first: 80 - 47 = 33. Now we have 28 left, and we need to reach 61 from 33 using 28.
Adding 28 to 33 gives us 61. So, the equation is 80 - 47 + 28 = 61.
</think>
<answer> (80 - 47) + 28 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list the numbers we have: 9, 87, and 7. We need to create an equation that equals 71 using each of these numbers exactly once.
We can try different combinations of operations:
- 87 - 9 = 78 (this is close but not equal to 71)
- 87 + 9 = 96 (this is not equal to 71 and we only have two numbers left)
- 87 - 7 = 80 (this isn't 71)
- 9 + 7 = 16 (this leaves 87, but 87 - 16 is not 71)
- 9 + 87 = 96 (this doesn't work)
- 87 + 7 - 9 = 85 (this is close but not 71)
- 9 + 87 - 7 = 91 (this is not 71)
- 87 - (9 - 7) = 87 - 2 = 85 (not 71)
- (9 + 7) * 87 / 100 = 16 * 0. 87 = 14. 08 (not 71, and we can't use 100 as it's not provided)
After trying various combinations, we realize we need to look another way. Let's try using division.
- 87 / 9 = 9. 666 (not an integer)
- 87 - (9 * 7) = 20 (not 71)
- 9 * 7 + 87 / 9 = 63 + 9. 666 = 72. 666 (not 71)
Finally, we find:
- 87 - 9 - 7 = 71 (this works)
</think>
<answer> 87 - 9 - 7 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 47, 48, and 71. We need to create an equation that equals 70 using each number only once and basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by looking at the numbers and how we might combine them:
- 71 - 47 = 24
- 71 - 48 = 23
- 48 + 47 = 95
None of these directly give us 70. Let's try different combinations:
- 71 - (48 + 47) = 71 - 95 = -24 (This is not 70)
- 71 - (48 / 47) does not work because 48 / 47 is a decimal and we can't use decimal results directly in such equations.
- (71 + 48) - 47 = 119 - 47 = 72 (This is too large)
- (71 + 47) - 48 = 118 - 48 = 70 (This looks promising)
So, the correct equation is: (71 + 47) - 48 = 70.
</think>
<answer>(71 + 47) - 48</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 92, 25, and 2. We need to create an equation that equals 65 using these numbers exactly once. Let's start by looking at the possible combinations:
- Adding the numbers: 92 + 25 + 2 = 119 (which is too large)
- Subtracting: 92 - 25 - 2 = 65 (this could be our solution)
- Multiplying: 92 * 25 * 2 = 4600 (way too large)
- Division: 92 / 25 / 2 = 1. 88 (not 65)
The combination of 92 - 25 - 2 equals 65, which satisfies the condition.
</think>
<answer> 92 - 25 - 2 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 39, 12, and 28. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once that equals 23.
One way to approach this is to see if we can combine any two of these numbers using operations to get a value close to 23, and then use the third number to reach the exact value.
If we subtract 12 from 28, we get 16. Now we need to get from 16 to 23 by using 39. We can do this by adding 39. So the equation would be 28 - 12 + 39 = 55. However, 55 is not 23.
Let's try another combination: 39 + 12 - 28. This simplifies to 41 - 28 = 13. We're still not at 23.
Lastly, let's try 39 - 28 + 12. This simplifies to 11 + 12 = 23. This gives us the exact result we need.
</think>
<answer> 39 - 28 + 12 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 39, 12, and 28. We need to create an equation that equals 23 using these numbers exactly once.
We can try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
39 - 12 = 27
This isn't 23, so let's try:
39 - 28 = 11
This is still not 23, so we can try:
28 - 12 = 16
Again, this isn't 23, but notice what happens if we rearrange the subtraction:
39 - 12 - 28 = -1
This is still not 23. Let's try multiplication or division to see if we can get closer:
39 * 12 / 28 is not an integer
28 * 12 / 39 is not an integer either
Now, let's consider 12 * 28 / 39, which is approximately 8.72, closer but not exact. The closest integer, 11, was previously close, but let's try another approach:
Perhaps 39 + 12 - 28 = 23
Indeed, this works as:
39 + 12 - 28 = 23
</think>
<answer> 39 + 12 - 28 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to create an equation that uses the numbers 90, 60, and 91 exactly once to equal 59. Let's start by trying to balance the values around the target number 59.
If we subtract 90 and 60, we get 90 + 60 = 150. Now, we need to find a way to reduce this from 150 to 59. We can do this by subtracting 91, which would give us:
150 - 91 = 59
This equation uses all the numbers exactly once and achieves the target of 59.
</think>
<answer> (90 + 60) - 91 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers 90, 60, and 91. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once that equals 59.
- 90 + 60 + 91 = 241 (This is too large)
- 90 + 60 - 91 = 59 (This is a good candidate)
- 90 + 91 - 60 = 121 (This is too large)
- 60 + 90 + 91 = 241 (This is too large)
- 60 + 91 - 90 = 61 (This is too large)
- 91 + 60 - 90 = 61 (This is too large)
From the calculations, we see that 90 + 60 - 91 equals 59.
</think>
<answer> 90 + 60 - 91 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 16, 54, and 8. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to equal 30.
16 + 54 = 70
This is close but not what we need.
Let's try a different combination:
54 - 16 = 38
This is still not 30.
Now, let's try multiplication and subtraction:
54 - (16 * 8 / 8) = 54 - 16 = 38
This is not correct either.
Since the direct subtraction and multiplication approach didn't work, let's try combining them in a different way:
We know 54 - 16 = 38. Now, we can use 8 in a way that brings us closer to 30:
38 - 8 = 30
Therefore, the equation is 54 - 16 - 8 = 30.
</think>
<answer> 54 - 16 - 8 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll list out the numbers we have: 48, 2, 67, and 89. We need to create an equation that equals 63 using these numbers exactly once.
- If I subtract 48 from 67, I get 19.
- Then adding 2 to 19 gives me 21.
- Now, to reach 63, I need an additional 42, but this is not possible with the remaining 89.
- What if I try multiplying 2 by 89, which gives me 178, and then subtracting 48 to see if I can get closer to 63.
- This gives me 178 - 48 = 130, which is too high.
- Let's try another combination: Using 89 * 2 = 178 and then subtracting 115 (which is 67 + 48).
- Interestingly, 178 - (67 + 48) = 178 - 115 = 63.
</think>
<answer> 89 * 2 - (48 + 67) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 16, 58, and 98. We need to use each number exactly once to make 24 using basic arithmetic operations.
- Let's try different combinations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- A good starting point might be multiplication and addition/subtraction.
- Let's look at 58 * (98 - 16). This simplifies to 58 * 82 = 4796, which is not 24.
- Now let's try 98 - (58 / 16), which gives us 98 - 3.625, resulting in a non-integer.
- Let's try another combination: 98 - 58 + 16. This simplifies to 32, which is not 24.
- Another attempt might be (98 + 58) / 16. This simplifies to 156 / 16 = 9.75, which still isn't right.
- Now, let's try a different order: (58 - 16) * 98 = 42 * 98 = 4116, which is not 24.
- Finally, let's try ((98 - 58) * 16). This simplifies to 40 * 16 = 640, which is also not 24.
- The correct way seems to be using the combination: (98 - 58) + 16. This simplifies to 40 + 16 = 56, which is not 24 either.
- Given the persistence in not getting 24, I realize we might have missed something simpler. Let's try 98 - ((58 - 16) * 1) = 98 - 42 = 56, which is still not 24.
- Upon rechecking, a simpler and correct approach is: 98 - 58 - 16, which simplifies to 24. </think>
<answer> 98 - 58 - 16 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to create an equation that equals 50 using the numbers 41, 52, 64, and 79 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
1. We could try to see if we can use subtraction: 79 - 64 - 52 + 41 = 25 - 11 = -14, which is not 50.
2. Next, let's try multiplication or division:
   - If we try 52 * 41 / 64 + 79, it's not straightforward.
   - If we do 79 - 64 * (52 / 41), we get 79 - 64 * 1. 265 = 79 - 81. 36 < 50.
   - Perhaps it's better to use:
   - 79 + 64 - 52 - 41 = 143 - 93 = 50.
</think>
<answer> 79 + 64 - 52 - 41 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 85, 94, and 67. We need to create an equation using these numbers only once and including basic arithmetic operations to get 76.
We can try different combinations:
- 94 - 85 = 9
- 94 - 67 = 27
- 85 - 67 = 18
None of the above combinations give us 76. 
Considering multiplication or division:
- 85 * 94 / 67 = 12350 / 67 ≈ 184. 33 (too high)
- 94 * 67 / 85 = 6218 / 85 ≈ 73. 3 (too low)
- 85 * 67 / 94 = 5655 / 94 ≈ 59. 9 (too low)
Let's try the order of numbers and operations again:
94 - 85 + 67 = 94 - 85 + 67 = 9 + 67 = 76
This combination results in 76.
</think>
<answer> 94 - 85 + 67 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list out the numbers we have: 85, 94, and 67. We need to create an equation that equals 76 using these numbers only once. 
We can start by subtracting 67 from 94, which gives us 27.
Then we need to combine 27 with the remaining number, 85, to make 76.
Adding 27 and 85 gives us 112, which is too high.
Subtracting 85 from 27 gives us -58, which is also too low.
Adding 85 to 27 gives us 112, which is not 76.
Subtracting 85 from 27 gives us -58, which is not 76.
What if we try subtracting 85 from 94 instead of 67 from 94? That would give us 94 - 85 = 9.
Now we need to combine 9 with 67. Adding these gives us 76.
Therefore, the equation is 94 - 85 + 67 = 76.
</think>
<answer> 94 - 85 + 67 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 58, 73, and 82. We need to create an equation that equals 67 using these numbers only once and with basic arithmetic operations.
One way to approach this is to look at the difference between the numbers. If we subtract 58 from 82, we get:
82 - 58 = 24
Now we need to get from 24 to 67 using the remaining number, 73. If we subtract 24 from 73, we get:
73 - 24 = 49
However, this does not give us our target of 67.
Another possibility is to consider multiplication or addition. If we multiply 73 by 2 (which is 2 * 73 = 146), and then subtract 82, we get:
146 - 82 = 64
This is close but still not our target.
It seems we need to re-examine our approach. Let's try a combination that subtracts one number from the sum of the other two:
(82 + 58) - 73 = 140 - 73 = 67
Now we have an equation that works using all the numbers exactly once and basic arithmetic.
</think>
<answer> (82 + 58) - 73 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's assess the numbers we have: 92, 27, and 12. We need to use these to make 53.
We can start by looking at the options. If we subtract 12 from 27, we get 15. That's a good intermediate step. 
Now, if we subtract 15 from 92, we get 77, which is not 53.
Next, let's try reversing the numbers. If we subtract 92 from 27, we get -65, which is not useful.
Let's try a combination: (92 - 27) + 12 = 65 + 12 = 77, which is still not 53.
Now, let's try: (92 - 65) + 12 = 27 + 12 = 39, which is not 53.
Finally, let's try: 92 - (27 + 12) = 92 - 39 = 53.
This gives us our desired result.
</think>
<answer> 92 - (27 + 12) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's analyze the given numbers: 26, 6, and 3. We need to combine these using basic arithmetic operations to get 35.
We can start by adding 6 and 3, which gives us 9.
Now we need 26 more to reach 35. We have the number 26 available, so we can check if 26 + 9 equals 35.
26 + 9 = 35
This works, meaning we've achieved our goal with the numbers 26, 6, and 3.
</think>
<answer> 26 + 6 + 3 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 26, 6, and 3. We need to use each number only once to reach the target of 35.
Let's start by adding 26 and 3: 26 + 3 = 29
Now we need 6 more to reach 35. So the equation would be:
26 + 3 + 6 = 35
This uses all the numbers and equals 35.
</think>
<answer> (26 + 3) + 6 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's analyze the numbers we have: 87, 45, and 89. We need to create an equation that results in 43 using these numbers exactly once.
- One way to start is to look at the order of the numbers and see if any of them can be combined with the others directly.
- 89 - 87 = 2, which doesn't give us 43.
- 89 - 45 = 44, which is close but not enough.
- 45 - 87 = -42, which is also not 43.
- 89 + 45 = 134, which is too large.
- Now let's try rearranging the operations: 45 + (87 - 89) = 45 + (-2) = 43.
This equation uses all the numbers exactly once and equals 43.
</think>
<answer> 45 + (87 - 89) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers 54, 81, and 17. Our goal is to create an equation that equals 44 using these numbers only once.
- If we look at the numbers closely, 81 is quite large and 54 is close to 44, while 17 is close to 10. 
- One potential approach is to see if we can use the operations to make 44 using 54 and 17, and then possibly adjusting for 81.
- Let's try to find a way to use 54 and 17 to get close to 44. If we subtract 17 from 54, we get 37. Now we need an additional 7 to get to 44 from 37.
- Adding 17 to 54 actually gives us 71, which is not useful.
- Instead, let's try another combination: (81 - 54) + 17. This gives us 27 + 17 = 44.
</think>
<answer> (81 - 54) + 17 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the given numbers: 34, 37, and 95. We need to create an equation that equals 98 using these numbers exactly once.
One way to approach this is to consider if we can add or subtract some of these numbers to get close to 98.
34 + 37 equals 71, which is close to 98 but a bit too low. If we add 95, we exceed 98.
37 + 95 equals 132, which is too high.
34 + 95 equals 129, which is also too high.
Looking at the options, if we subtract 34 from 95, we get 61. Now we need 38 more to reach 98, and we have 37 left.
37 + 38 equals 75, and indeed, 98 - 61 = 37.
So, subtracting 34 from 95 and then adding 37 gives us 98.
</think>
<answer> 95 - 34 + 37 </answer>

<think> First, let's try different combinations using the numbers 45, 46, and 6 with basic arithmetic operations to get to 97.
We can start by adding or subtracting the numbers and see if we can get close to 97.
45 + 46 = 91
This gives us a number close to 97, but we need more. Let's try adding 6 to 91:
91 + 6 = 97
This works! So we have our equation.
</think>
<answer> 45 + 46 + 6 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to create an equation using the numbers 45, 46, and 6 that equals 97. Let's try different combinations of operations.
One way to approach this is to see if we can add or subtract some of these numbers to get closer to 97.
If we add 45 and 46, we get 91. Now, we need an additional 6 to reach 97.
The equation that works is: (45 + 46) + 6.
Let's verify:
(45 + 46) + 6 = 91 + 6 = 97.
</think>
<answer> (45 + 46) + 6 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 42, 58, and 39. We need to create an equation that equals 55 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
- If we subtract 39 from 58, we get 19.
- Then, subtracting 42 from 19 will not give us 55.
- We need to find another combination or operation.
- Let's try 58 - 39 + 42:
  58 - 39 = 19
  19 + 42 = 61
  This is close, but not equal to 55.
- We need to adjust this approach.
- Let's try another subtraction:
  58 - 42 = 16
  Now we have 16 + 39 = 55.
This gives us the correct result and uses all the numbers only once.
</think>
<answer> 58 - 42 + 39 </answer>

<think> First, let's list out the numbers we have: 96, 32, and 28. We need to create an equation that equals 92 using each number once.
We can start by looking at the difference between 96 and 92:
96 - 92 = 4
Now we have 4, 32, and 28 left.
Next, let's check if 32 - 28 = 4:
32 - 28 = 4
This works! Now we can create our equation using 96, 32, and 28, with the intermediate result of 4:
96 - 32 + 28 = 92

<answer> 96 - 32 + 28 </answer>

- Adding these numbers: 72 + 77 + 43 = 192 (too high)
- Subtracting: 72 - 77 + 43 = 38 (this seems promising)
Let's verify:
72 - 77 + 43 = -5 + 43 = 38
This satisfies our equation.

<think> First, we need to create an equation that equals 70 using the numbers 58, 9, and 21 exactly once. Let's start by checking if we can combine these numbers to get close to 70.
58 + 9 + 21 = 88 (which is too high)
58 + 21 + 9 = 90 (also too high)
9 + 21 + 58 = 78 (closer, but still not 70)
Now, let's try some combinations using subtraction, to see if we can get closer.
58 - 21 + 9 = 46 (too low)
9 - 21 + 58 = 46 (also too low)
Finally, let's try:
58 + 21 - 9
This equals 70.
</think>
<answer> 58 + 21 - 9 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 2, 16, and 84. We need to create an equation that uses these numbers exactly once and equals 70.
Looking at 16 and 54, we notice that 84 - 16 = 68. Now we need to add 2 to get to 70. Since we can only use each number once, 54 can be obtained by subtracting 16 from 84. But we need to express 54 as (84 - 16), and we need 2. We can use 2 in the calculation because adding 2 to (84 - 16) will give us 70.
So, the equation is: 2 + (84 - 16) = 70.
</think>
<answer> 2 + (84 - 16) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 31, 33, and 19. We need to create an equation that uses these numbers exactly once to get the result of 17.
- If we subtract 19 from 31, we get 12.
- If we then subtract 33 from 12, we get -22, which is not what we want.
- Now, let's try combining numbers in a different way: adding 19 and 31 gives us 50.
- Then, if we subtract 33 from 50, we get 17.
So, the equation would be 19 + 31 - 33 = 17.
</think>
<answer> 19 + 31 - 33 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 31, 33, and 19 exactly once to equal 17. 
Looking at the numbers, I notice that 19 is close to 17, so I can subtract 19 from a combination of 31 and 33 to get 17.
33 - 19 = 14
31 - 19 = 12
If I subtract 12 from 14, I get 2, which is too small to reach 17.
Instead, I should consider combining these numbers in another way. 
Let me try: (33 - 31) + 19 = 2 + 19 = 21, which is too big.
Now, let's try: (33 + 19) - 31 = 52 - 31 = 21, which is also too big.
Finally, let me try: (33 + 19) - 31 = 52 - 31 = 21, and then subtract 21:  32 - 21 = 11, which is still not 17.
Wait, I can simplify my approach. If I use 31 - (33 - 19), I get:
31 - (33 - 19) = 31 - 14 = 17
This equation works, using all three numbers exactly once.
</think>
<answer> 31 - (33 - 19) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 2, 9, and 33. We need to create an equation that equals 26 using each number exactly once.
- If we look at the numbers, we can see that 33 - 9 = 24. This is a good start.
- Now, we need an operation to get from 24 to 26. Adding 2 to 24 would give us 26.
So, the equation would be 33 - 9 + 2 = 26.
</think>
<answer> (33 - 9) + 2 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 2, 9, and 33. We need to create an equation that equals 26 using each number exactly once.
- If we consider addition, 2 + 9 + 33 = 44, which is too high.
- Let's try subtraction: 33 - 9 - 2 = 22, which is still not 26.
- Now, let's try multiplication and addition: 33 * 2 - 9 = 66 - 9 = 57, which is too high.
- If we try 33 - 9 * 2, that gives us 33 - 18 = 15, still not 26.
- Let's try a different approach: 33 + 2 - 9 = 35 - 9 = 26.
So, 33 + 2 - 9 equals 26.
</think>
<answer> 33 + 2 - 9 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list the numbers we have: 65, 79, 49, and 19. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once that equals 44.
One way to approach this is to see if any combination of these numbers and basic arithmetic operations can give us 44.
Let's try subtraction:
79 - 65 = 14
Now we need an additional 30 to reach 44:
14 + 30 = 44
So we need to use 19 and 49 to get 30. We can do this with:
49 - 19 = 30
Putting it all together:
79 - 65 + 49 - 19 = 44
</think>
<answer> 79 - 65 + 49 - 19 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 39, 28, and 7 that equals 74. Let's start by adding 39 and 28, which gives us 67. Now, we need an additional 7 to reach 74. The number 7 is already available, so we can simply add it to 67. Therefore, the equation will be 39 + 28 + 7.
</think>
<answer> 39 + 28 + 7 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 3, 26, and 60. We need to use these numbers exactly once to get a result of 46 using basic arithmetic operations.
One way to achieve this is to consider multiplication and addition:
- We know that 60 / 3 = 20
- Now if we add 26 to 20, we get 20 + 26 = 46
This satisfies the condition of using each number exactly once and results in 46.
</think>
<answer> (60 / 3) + 26 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers and think about how we can combine them to get 44. We have 18, 10, 55, and 17.
- If we add 55 and 17, we get 72, which is too high.
- If we subtract 17 from 55, we get 38, which is still high.
- We can add 55 and 10 to get 65, which is too high as well.
- If we subtract 10 from 55, we get 45, which is close.
- Adding 18 to 45 gives us 63, still not 44.
- Now, let's try a different combination: subtracting 18 from 55 gives 37, and then adding 10 gives us 47, which is still not 44.
- Finally, subtracting 10 from 55 gives 45, and then subtracting 18 gives us 27, and finally adding 17 gives us 44.
</think>
<answer> (55 - 10) - 18 + 17 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 16, 9, and 66. We need to use each exactly once to get 41.
- If we add 16 and 9, we get 25. We need an additional 16 to make 41.
- Alternatively, if we subtract a number from 66, 41 is 25 less than 66. So, 66 - 25 should be 41.
Thus, we can use the equation: (66 - 16) - 9 = 41.
</think>
<answer> (66 - 16) - 9 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 43, 96, and 29. We need to use each number exactly once to make the equation equal to 82.
- Adding or subtracting these numbers gives results far from 82.
- Multiplying and dividing doesn't seem to help much since the results would be too large or too small to reach 82 by simply using one operation.
- Let's try combining them in a combination of addition and multiplication/division:
  - We have 96 and 29, if we add these we get 125, which is close to 82 but too high.
  - If we subtract 43 from 96 we get 53. Now we need to get from 53 to 82 using 29. We can do this by adding 29 to 53.
  - So, the equation becomes: 96 - 43 + 29 = 82.
</think>
<answer> 96 - 43 + 29 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 54, 7, and 50. We need to create an equation that equals 11 using each number only once and basic arithmetic operations.
One way to approach this is to try various combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
If we look at 54 - 50 = 4, we see it's not 11.
Let's try 54 - 7 = 47, and then 47 - 50 = -3, neither of these give us our target number.
However, if we rearrange the operations, consider 54 - 50 = 4 and then 4 + 7 = 11.
Thus, the equation works out to be 54 - 50 + 7 = 11.
</think>
<answer> 54 - 50 + 7 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list the numbers we have: 2, 36, and 70. We need to use each of these numbers exactly once to get a result of 88.
We can start by looking at the possible compositions of these numbers using addition and subtraction:
- 36 + 70 = 106
- 70 + 2 = 72
- 36 + 2 = 38
None of these immediately work. Let's try multiplication and addition:
- 36 * 2 = 72, and then 72 + 70 = 142 (too high)
- 70 * 2 = 140, and then 140 + 36 = 176 (too high)
- 2 * 70 = 140, and then 140 + 36 = 176 (still too high)
Let's try a different combination:
- 70 - 36 = 34, and then 34 + 2 = 36 (this is not 88, but let's see what happens if we rearrange further)
- 36 - 2 = 34, and then 34 + 70 = 104 (still too high)
Let's try combinations with division:
- 70 / 2 = 35, and then 35 + 36 = 71 (too low)
- 36 / 2 = 18, and then 18 + 70 = 88 (this works)
So, the equation is 36 / 2 + 70 = 88.
</think>
<answer> 36 / 2 + 70 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 76 using the numbers 31, 88, 42, and 1. Let's try different combinations of operations.
One possibility is to use subtraction and addition:
88 - 31 + 42 = 100
This is close but not 76.
Another possibility is to use multiplication and addition:
(88 - 42) * 1 + 31 = 46 + 31 = 77
This is close but still not 76.
Let's try:
88 + 42 - 31 = 130 - 31 = 100
This also doesn't work.
Now, let's try combining them differently:
42 + 88 - 31 = 128 - 31 = 97
This is still not 76.
Finally, let's try this:
88 + 31 + 42 - 1 = 120 + 42 - 1 = 162 - 1 = 161
This is too high.
Given the constraints and the search through these possibilities, I realize I may have overlooked the simplest combination:
31 + 88 - 42 = 119 - 42 = 77
Close, but not 76.
The correct combination seems to be:
42 + 88 - 31 - 1 = 130 - 32 = 98
So, let's go for this:
42 + 88 - 31 = 120 - 31 = 89
Still not 76.
Finally, let's try:
88 - 42 + 31 = 46 + 31 = 77
This is close, and after multiple tries and combinations, I find:
88 + 31 - 42 - 1 = 119 - 43 = 76
Now I have the correct combination.
</think>
<answer> 88 + 31 - 42 - 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 31, 88, 42, and 1. We need to use these exactly once to make 76.
One approach is to try combining the numbers in a way that utilizes the larger numbers to get close to 76.
Let's start with 88 - 42 = 46. Now we need an additional 30 to reach 76.
Next, we notice that 31 - 1 = 30.
So we have 88 - 42 + 31 - 1 = 76.
This uses each number exactly once and results in 76.
</think>
<answer> 88 - 42 + 31 - 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 31, 88, 42, and 1. We need to use these numbers exactly once to get an equation that equals 76.
Looking at the numbers, we can try different combinations using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Multiplying 88 by 1 gives us 88. This is close to 76, but we need to get to 76, not 88.
Subtracting 31 from 88 gives us 57. This is not 76.
Dividing 88 by 42 doesn't work out nicely since it results in a decimal and 1 is missing.
Now, consider adding or subtracting the remaining numbers (31 and 42) to or from 88:
88 + 42 = 130 (which is too high)
88 - 31 = 57 (closer, but still not 76)
88 - 31 - 42 = -8 (which is not 76)
Another way to think is to consider combining numbers differently:
88 - 31 - 42 + 1 gives us 14, which is still not 76.
88 - 31 + 42 - 1 = 98 - 1 = 97 (too high again).
Looking for an intermediate result within the set:
(88 - 42) + (31 - 1) = 46 + 30 = 76
This way, we get:
88 - 42 + 31 - 1 = 76
</think>
<answer> (88 - 42 + 31 - 1) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list out the numbers we have: 48, 39, and 34. We need to use these exactly once to get a result of 43.
- We can try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Let's start with subtraction: 48 - 39 = 9, and then 9 + 34 = 43.
- This combination works as it uses each number exactly once and achieves the target result.
</think>
<answer> 48 - 39 + 34 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 93, 34, and 40. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get 87.
Let's try different combinations:
- 93 - 34 = 59 (not 87)
- 93 - 40 = 53 (not 87)
- 34 - 40 = -6 (not 87)
- 93 + 34 = 127 (not 87)
- 93 + 40 = 133 (not 87)
- 34 + 40 = 74 (not 87)
- Now let's try adding and subtracting in a different order:
- 93 + 40 - 34 = 99 - 34 = 65 (not 87)
- Let's try 40 + 34 - 93 = 74 - 93 = -19 (not 87)
- The last combination we haven't tried is:
- 93 - 40 + 34 = 53 + 34 = 87
This combination gives us the correct result of 87.
</think>
<answer> 93 - 40 + 34 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 6, 70, and 39. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once that equals 25.
- Adding 6 and 39 gives 45.
- Subtracting 6 and 39 gives -33.
- Adding 6 and 70 gives 76.
- Subtracting 70 and 39 gives -31.
- Multiplying 6 and 70 gives 420.
- Multiplying 6 and 39 gives 234.
- Multiplying 70 and 39 gives 2730.
None of these straightforward operations give us 25. Now let's try subtracting:
- 70 - 39 = 31
- 31 - 6 = 25
This combination gives us 25. Therefore, the equation is 70 - 39 - 6 = 25.
</think>
<answer> 70 - 39 - 6 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 6, 70, and 39. We need to use each number exactly once to make the expression equal to 25.
- We can start by looking at the sum and difference of the numbers. 70 + 39 = 109, which is too large.
- 70 - 39 = 31, which is closer but still too large.
- Let's try 70 - 6 - 39 = 25. This seems promising as it uses each number exactly once and results in 25.
</think>
<answer> 70 - 6 - 39 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list our numbers: 6, 70, and 39. We need to create an expression using these numbers exactly once that equals 25.
We can start by looking at the target number and the numbers we have. One approach is to see if we can combine 70 and 39 in a way that, when we subtract or add, we get closer to 25.
If we subtract 39 from 70, we get 31. This is close but not quite 25. Adding 6 to 31 gives us 37, which is too high.
If we try subtracting 6 from 70 first, we get 64. Then subtracting 39 from 64 gives us 25.
So, the equation can be (70 - 6) - 39 = 25.
</think>
<answer>(70 - 6) - 39</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 4, 70, and 34. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once, and the result should be 40.
- One way to approach this is to consider if we can combine these numbers using addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
- If we subtract 34 from 70, we get 36 (70 - 34 = 36).
- Then, if we add 4 to 36, we get 40 (36 + 4 = 40).
- This works, and we have used all the numbers exactly once.
So, the equation is 70 - 34 + 4 = 40.
</think>
<answer> 70 - 34 + 4 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers: 79, 74, 69, and 52. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once and end up with the result 22.
79 + 74 - 69 - 52 = 54 - 52 = 2
We are not quite there, so let's try a different combination.
79 - 74 + 69 - 52 = 5 + 69 - 52 = 69 - 49 = 20
Still not right. Let's try a different approach.
79 - 74 - 69 + 52 = 5 - 69 + 52 = -64 + 52 = -12
Nothing is working. Let's try one more combination.
79 - 74 + 69 - 52 = 5 + 69 - 52 = 69 - 47 = 22
Ah, we found it! The equation 79 - 74 + 69 - 52 equals 22.
</think>
<answer> 79 - 74 + 69 - 52 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 79, 74, 69, and 52. Our goal is to create an equation that equals 22 using these numbers exactly once.
- Adding or subtracting these numbers won't easily reach 22.
- Multiplying and dividing these numbers also doesn't seem promising as it would usually lead to larger or smaller numbers.
- Let's try combining subtraction and addition:
  - 79 - 74 = 5
  - 69 - 52 = 17
  - Adding these results: 5 + 17 = 22
This combination works, and we have used all the numbers exactly once.
</think>
<answer> 79 - 74 + 69 - 52 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 85, 60, and 39. We need to create an equation that equals 64 using these numbers only once.
- If we subtract 39 from 85, we get 46.
- Then, subtracting 60 from 46 brings us to -2.
- However, -2 is not equal to 64.
- Let's try another combination. If we take 85 and subtract 60, we get 25.
- Now, if we add 39 to 25, we get 64.
This gives us the equation 85 - 60 + 39 = 64.
</think>
<answer> 85 - 60 + 39 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 2, 36, and 51. We need to use each number exactly once to create an equation that equals 17.
We can start by looking at what combinations of these numbers and basic arithmetic operations could potentially give us 17.
- 36 - 2 = 34 (not 17)
- 36 - 51 = -9 (not 17)
- 51 - 36 = 15 (not 17)
- 51 - 2 = 49 (not 17)
- 36 + 2 = 38 (not 17)
- 51 + 2 = 53 (not 17)
- 36 * 2 / 51 is not a whole number and doesn't equal 17
- 36 / 2 + 51 = 18 + 51 = 69 (not 17)
- 51 / 2 + 36 = 25. 5 + 36 (not an integer)
- 51 / 36 + 2 = 1. 4166 + 2 (not 17)
Now, let's try another permutation:
51 - 36 + 2 = 15 + 2 = 17
This combination works!
</think>
<answer> 51 - 36 + 2 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 1, 19, and 49. We need to use each exactly once to get a result of 31.
We can start by trying to form combinations with the larger numbers first since they have more significant impact on the result.
19 + 14 doesn't work because 14 isn't one of our numbers.
However, 49 - 19 = 30, which is very close to 31.
If we use 19 - 49, it would be -30, so that's not helpful.
But, we can see (49 - 19) + 1 = 31.
So, the equation is 49 - 19 + 1 = 31.
</think>
<answer> 49 - 19 + 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 53, 16, and 29. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get a result of 40.
Let's try combining these numbers with basic arithmetic operations:
- Adding them together: 53 + 16 + 29 = 98 (too high)
- Subtracting: Trying combinations like 53 - 16 - 29 = 0 or similar doesn't get us to 40.
- Multiplying: 53 * 16 / 29 doesn't seem to simplify to 40.
- Another combination: Let's try 53 - 29 + 16. 
  53 - 29 = 24
  24 + 16 = 40
This gives us the result of 40, using each number once.
</think>
<answer> 53 - 29 + 16 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 53, 16, and 29. We need to use these numbers exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 40.
- We can try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Let's start with 53 - 16 = 37. Now we need 3 more to reach 40.
- If we subtract 37 - 29 = -10 which is not 40.
- Let's try 53 - 29 = 24. Now we need 16 more to reach 40, which is 40 - 24 = 16.
- We can see that 53 - 29 + 16 does not equal 40 directly.
- Let's try another combination: 29 + 16 = 45. This gets us above 40, so it’s not helpful.
- Let's try 53 + 16 = 69. This is also too high.
- Now let's try a different sequence: 53 + 29 - 16. This simplifies to 82 - 16 = 66, which is still not 40.
- It seems like we're not getting 40 with just these combinations.
- Let's check another possibility considering the numbers directly: 53 - (29 + 16). This simplifies to 53 - 45 = 8, which is not 40.
- Finally, let's consider 53 - (29 - 16). This simplifies to 53 - 13 = 40.
</think>
<answer> 53 - (29 - 16) </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to create an equation using the numbers 53, 16, and 29 that results in 40. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- If we try 53 - 16 - 29, we get 53 - 16 = 37, and 37 - 29 = 8 (not 40).
- Trying 53 + 16 - 29 gives us 69 - 29 = 40 (this works!).
- 53 + 16 * 29 gives us 53 + 414 = 467 (not 40).
So, the correct combination appears to be 53 + 16 - 29 = 40.
</think>
<answer> 53 + 16 - 29 </answer>

<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 25, 48, and 73. We need to create an equation that equals 50 using each number only once and with basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by considering if the sum or difference of any two numbers could be the number we need (50) or if one of the numbers can be manipulated to reach 50.
- Adding 25 and 48 gives us 73, which is too high.
- Subtracting 48 from 73 gives us 25, and then we would need to subtract 25 to get 50, but we have used 25 already.
- Adding 73 and 25 gives us 98, which is too high.
- Subtracting 25 from 73 gives us 48, and then we would need to subtract 48 to get 50, but we have used 48 already.
- Multiplying 25 by 2 would give us 50, but we can't use multiplication as per the rules.
- Dividing 73 by 1.4667 would give us 50, but these are not integers and we can't use division with these numbers.
It seems the direct sums, differences, and multiplications don't work. However, let's check if mixing operations could work. 
Considering 73 - 48 = 25, and then 25 + 50 - 73 - 48 + 25, we don't get 50. 
But if we focus on 73 - 48 = 25 and another approach, let's try 73 - (48 + 25) which simplifies to 73 - 73 = 0, which is not 50.
Considering 73 + (48 - 25) simplifies to 73 + 23 = 96, which is too high.
The solution seems elusive until we try 48 + (73 - 25) = 48 + 48 = 96 which doesn't work either.
Trying 73 - 48 - (25 - 50) = 73 - 48 - (-15) = 73 - 48 + 15 = 25 + 15 = 40 which is not 50.
Finally, rechecking with operations, the only way seems:
25 + 48 = 73, and then 73 - 25 = 48, and adding to achieve 50. 
We realize our need to reconsider simplifying 73 - (48+25) gives 0, and missed 50 = 73 + (25-48) = 73 - 23 = 50.
</think>
<answer> 73 - (48 - 25) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 17, 5, and 77. We need to create an equation that equals 12 using these numbers exactly once.
- Starting with addition: 17 + 5 = 22, which is too high. 17 + 77 = 94, which is also too high.
- Trying subtraction: 77 - 17 = 60, which is too high. 77 - 5 = 72, which is also too high.
- Multiplication: 17 * 5 = 85, which is too high. 77 * 5 = 385, which is far too high.
- Division: 77 / 17 = 4.529, which isn't an integer and doesn't work. 17 / 5 = 3.4, which also isn't an integer and doesn't work.
Given the constraints, it seems straightforward to try other combinations or see if we can do something unusual like using concatenation or rounding.
Considering the basic operations, it seems we're left with the possibility of forming a fraction or complex expression involving these numbers. But since the instructions state each number must be used only once and we're limited to basic arithmetic, let's try another pathway.
Given the lack of success in simple operations, let's consider another angle. We can use the numbers as part of a formula involving addition, subtraction, and division, ensuring each number is used only once.
Let's form the equation (77 - 17) / 5 = 12.
(77 - 17) / 5 = 60 / 5 = 12. This satisfies our condition.
</think>
<answer>(77 - 17) / 5</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 43, 90, and 30. We need to use these numbers exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 77.
- Adding or subtracting the numbers does not get us close to 77.
- Multiplying 90 by any of the other numbers gives results too large or too small.
- Dividing 90 by 30 equals 3, which is too small.
- If we subtract 30 from 90, we get 60. Then subtracting 43 from 60 gives us 17, which is still not 77.
- Now, let's consider: 90 - 30 = 60, and 60 + 17 = 77. But 17 is not directly obtainable from the numbers.
- Looking closer, if we use the numbers 43 and 30 in division: 90 - 43 = 47. Then, 47 + 30 equals 77.
This seems correct as 90 - 43 = 47 and 47 + 30 = 77.
</think>
<answer> 90 - 43 + 30 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list out the numbers we have: 7, 97, and 58. We need to use each number exactly once to make 46 using basic arithmetic operations.
We can try different combinations:
- 97 + 58 - 7 = 150, which is too high.
- 97 + 7 - 58 = 46, which seems promising.
This combination works because 97 + 7 is 104, and then subtracting 58 gives us 46.
</think>
<answer> 97 + 7 - 58 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a combination of 7, 97, and 58 using basic arithmetic operations that results in 46. Let's try different combinations:
1. 97 - 58 - 7 = 32
2. 97 - 58 + 7 = 46 (This is a potential solution)
3. 97 + 58 - 7 = 148
4. 7 + 58 - 97 = -12
5. 7 * 58 / 97, 58 * 7 / 97, 97 * 58 / 7 don't result in 46
The second combination shows that 97 - 58 + 7 equals 46.
</think>
<answer> 97 - 58 + 7 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers available: 51, 60, and 50. We need to create an equation that equals 61 using each of these numbers exactly once.
We can try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- If we add 60 and 51, we get 111, which is too high.
- If we subtract 50 from 60, we get 10, which is too low.
- If we multiply 51 by 50, we get 2550, which is far too high.
- If we divide 60 by 50, we get 1. 2, which is not an integer and not useful here.
Let's try 60 - 51 + 50:
- 60 - 51 = 9
- 9 + 50 = 59
This is still not 61.
Now let's try another combination:
- 60 + 51 - 50:
  - 60 + 51 = 111
  - 111 - 50 = 61
This gives us the desired result of 61 using all the numbers exactly once.
</think>
<answer> 60 + 51 - 50 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 51, 60, and 50. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to equal 61.
- One way to approach this is to think about how we can use addition or subtraction to reach close to 61.
- Adding 60 and 50 gives us 110, which is too high.
- Adding 60 and 51 gives us 111, also too high.
- Subtracting 50 from 60 gives us 10, which is too low.
- If we add 51 and 50, we get 101, which is still too high.
- Now let's try something different: 60 - 51 + 50.
- This simplifies to 9 + 50, which equals 59.
- That's still not 61.
- Let's try another combination: 60 - 50 + 51
- This simplifies to 10 + 51, which equals 61.
This last combination works.
</think>
<answer> 60 - 50 + 51 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to create an equation using the numbers 50, 40, 53, and 76 to get 33. Let's start by adding 53 and 40, which gives us 93. Then we need to reduce this sum by some value to get to 33. So, 93 - 33 = 60. Now we have 60 and the remaining numbers 50 and 76. If we add 50 and 76, we get 126. To reach 60 from 126, we need to subtract 66, but we only have the numbers 50 and 76 left. Let's try subtracting 50 and 76 from 126 directly: 126 - 50 - 76 = 10. So, 93 + (50 + 76 - 126) = 93 + 0 = 93, which is too high.
Now, let's try another combination: 50 + 53 - 76 - 40 gives us 43 - 36 = 7, which is too low.
Finally, let's try: (76 - 53) + 40 - 50 = 23 + 40 - 50 = 63 - 50 = 13, which is still not 33.
However, if we reverse the order and use the numbers in this sequence: 53 + 40 - 76 - 50 = 93 - 126 = -33, we're still off. Really, the sequence 53 - 50 + 40 - 76 = 3 gives us the result 3, not 33.
After reconsidering, a direct combination might be overlooked: (76 - 50) + (53 - 40) = 26 + 13 = 39, which is off as well.
The correct approach seems to be: 76 + (50 - 40) - 53 = 76 + 10 - 53 = 33.
</think>
<answer> 76 + (50 - 40) - 53 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 82, 64, 52, and 51. We need to create an equation that equals 43 using each number exactly once.
We can start by trying combinations of the numbers with basic arithmetic operations.
Looking at the numbers, 82 - 64 = 18, which is close but not 43. Then, 82 - 64 - 52 = -34, which is still not 43.
Let's try another approach: 82 - 64 + 51 = 79, which is too high.
Now, let's try a different order: 82 - 64 + 52 = 70, also too high.
Next, let's try combining numbers in a different way: 82 - 64 + 51 = 70, and 70 + 52 - 64 = 60, still not 43.
Let's consider 51 + 52 - 64 = 39, far from 43. 
Finally, let's test: 82 - 51 - 52 + 64 = 43. This seems promising.
Let's verify: 82 - 51 = 31, 31 - 52 = -21, and -21 + 64 = 43.
So, the correct equation is 82 - 51 - 52 + 64 = 43.
</think>
<answer> 82 - 51 - 52 + 64 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 95, 28, and 75. We need to create an equation that equals 48 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by looking at the numbers and seeing if any simple combinations work. Subtracting 28 from 95 gives us 67. Then, if we subtract 75 from 67, we get -8, which is not equal to 48.
Next, let's try multiplying 95 by 28 and then subtracting 75: 95 * 28 - 75 = 2660 - 75 = 2585. This is too large.
Now, let's try dividing 95 by 28 and then adding 75: 95 / 28 + 75 is approximately 2.39 + 75 = 77.39. This is also not 48.
Let's try a different approach: combining the numbers in a different way using addition, subtraction, and multiplication. 75 + 28 = 103. Now, we need 48 - 103 = -55, which is not possible with the given numbers since -55 isn't formed by subtraction or multiplication of 95, 28, and 75.
Lastly, let's try: 95 - (28 * 1) + 75 = 95 - 28 + 75 = 67 + 75 - 28 = 142 - 28 = 114, which is wrong.
Finally, finding the right solution:
1. Add 28 and 75: 28 + 75 = 103
2. Subtract 95 from this sum: 103 - 95 = 8
3. We need to reach 48, so we do: 48 - 8 = 40
4. But we are one step short, so instead of 40, we add 40:
103 - 95 = 8 + (40 - 8) = 8 + 32 = 40
Now, correct approach to get to 48 is: 
95 - 75 + 28 = 20 + 28 = 48
</think>
<answer> 95 - 75 + 28 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 60, 87, and 59. We need to create an equation that equals 88 using each number exactly once and only the basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by looking at the operations we can use:
- Addition: +
- Subtraction: -
- Multiplication: *
- Division: /
We need to try different combinations. Let's start with some straightforward operations.
87 - 60 = 27, which is close to 88 but not quite there.
87 - 59 = 28, which is also not quite 88.
Now, let's try 87 - 60 + 59.
87 - 60 + 59 = 127 - 60 = 67.
That's still not correct. Let's try another arrangement:
60 - 59 + 87
60 - 59 + 87 = 1 + 87 = 88.
This gives us the correct result.
</think>
<answer> 60 - 59 + 87 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 72, 32, and 72. We need to create an equation that equals 32 using each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
- We can start by looking at the numbers 72 and 32. We notice that \( 72 - 32 = 40 \).
- Now we need another number to get to 32 from 40. The number 72 could be useful here. If we take \( 40 - 72 \), we get -32, which is not what we want.
- Instead, let's try using the minus sign in a different way. If we take \( 72 - (72 - 32) \), we first compute the operation inside the parentheses: \( 72 - 32 = 40 \), and then subtract this from 72: \( 72 - 40 = 32 \).
- This works! We have used all three numbers exactly once and created an equation that equals 32.
</think>
<answer> 72 - (72 - 32) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list out the numbers we have: 1, 13, and 17. We need to create an equation that equals 31 using each number exactly once.
We can start by checking if any of these numbers, or their combinations, can be used to get close to 31.
If we add 13 and 17, we get 30. Now we need to get to 31, and we have 1 left. Adding 1 to 30 gives us 31.
So the equation is: 13 + 17 + 1 = 31.
</think>
<answer> 13 + 17 + 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 26, 23, 81, and 16. We need to create an equation that equals 94 using each number exactly once.
We can start by checking if any of these numbers are close to 94 or if their sum or difference can help us. Adding all the numbers gives us 146, which is too high.
Considering multiplication or division, we see that none of the numbers can be easily combined with others to get close to 94 without exceeding it.
Now let's try combinations:
- 81 - 23 = 58
- 58 + 26 = 84
- Adding 16: 84 + 16 = 100 (too high)
Instead, let's try another combination:
- 81 - 26 = 55
- 55 + 23 = 78
- Adding 16: 78 + 16 = 94 (this works)
So, the equation using the numbers 81, 26, 23, and 16 to get 94 is 81 - 26 + 23 + 16 = 94.
</think>
<answer> 81 - 26 + 23 + 16 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 21, 49, 99, and 60. We need to use each number exactly once to make an equation that equals 31.
We can start by looking at the different ways we can combine 21 and 49:
- 21 + 49 = 70
- 49 - 21 = 28
Next, we can combine these results with 99 and 60:
- 70 + 28 + 60 = 158 (which is not 31)
- 70 + 28 - 99 = 19 - 99 = -81 (which is not 31)
- 70 + 28 - 60 = 28 - 60 = -32 (which is not 31)
- 28 - 99 + 70 = -71 + 70 = -1 (which is not 31)
- 28 - 99 + 60 = -71 + 60 = -11 (which is not 31)
- 28 - 60 + 70 = -32 + 70 = 38 (which is not 31)
Now, let's try including 99 in different combinations:
- 99 + 21 + 49 = 149 (which is not 31)
- 99 + 21 - 49 = 72 - 49 = 23 (which is not 31)
- 99 + 49 - 21 = 148 - 21 = 127 (which is not 31)
- 99 + 49 + 21 = 149 (which is not 31)
Finally, looking at different combinations with 60:
- 60 + 49 - 21 = 109 - 21 = 88 (which is not 31)
- 60 + 21 - 49 = 81 - 49 = 32 (which is not 31)
- 60 - 21 + 49 = 39 + 49 = 88 (which is not 31)
After trying all these combinations, it seems like we haven't found a solution yet. However, let's try combining all the numbers together in different orders:
- 99 - 60 + 21 + 49 = 39 + 21 + 49 = 60 + 49 = 109 (which is not 31)
- 99 + 60 - 21 - 49 = 159 - 70 = 89 (which is not 31)
- 99 + 21 - 49 + 60 = 120 - 49 = 71 (which is not 31)
- 99 - 60 + 49 + 21 = 39 + 49 = 88 (which is not 31)
None of these combinations result in 31, but let's try another approach:
- 49 * 21 / 99 + 60 = 1029 / 99 + 60 = 10. 4 + 60 = 70. 4 (which is not 31)
It becomes clear that this particular combination of numbers and operations does not result in 31. There seems to be an oversight in the problem constraints or options. Unfortunately, based on the given set of numbers and operations, no solution equates to 31.
</think>
<answer> 21 + 49 - 99 + 60 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 11, 20, and 68. We need to create an equation that equals 59 using these numbers exactly once.
We can start by checking if any combination of the numbers in different orders can give us 59.
11 + 20 = 31
11 + 68 = 79
20 + 68 = 88
Now, let's try operations between the numbers:
11 + 20 - 68 = -37
11 + 68 - 20 = 59
This shows that the equation 11 + 68 - 20 equals 59.
</think>
<answer> 11 + 68 - 20 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 74, 55, and 11. We need to create an equation that equals 30 using each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations. 
- Let's try combining 74 and 11 first: 74 + 11 = 85. This is closer to 30 than we need, so we might need to subtract 55 or use subtraction to adjust the result.
- Now, let's see if we can use 55 in a way that helps us reach 30. If we subtract 55 from 85, we get 30: 85 - 55 = 30.
So, the equation is 74 + 11 - 55 = 30.
</think>
<answer> 74 + 11 - 55 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 74, 55, and 11 that equals 30. I should start by considering how these numbers might combine through addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
Let's try some combinations:
- 74 + 55 + 11 = 139 (too high)
- 74 + 55 - 11 = 118 (still too high)
- 74 + 55 / 11 = 80 (too high)
- 55 + 11 + 74 = 139 (this is not equal to 30)
- 74 / 11 + 55 = 8 + 55 = 63 (too high)
- 74 - 55 + 11 = 30 (this equals 30)
So, the equation 74 - 55 + 11 equals 30 using each number only once.
</think>
<answer> 74 - 55 + 11 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 63, 51, and 42. We need to create an equation that results in 54 using each number exactly once.
One approach is to consider the differences and sums between these numbers.
Let's try: 63 - 51 + 42
63 - 51 = 12
12 + 42 = 54
This gives us our result of 54 using all the numbers exactly once.
</think>
<answer> 63 - 51 + 42 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 21, 66, and 2. We need to create an equation that equals 85 using each of these numbers only once.
We can start by adding or subtracting these numbers:
- Adding 21 and 66 gives us 87, which is too high.
- Subtracting 2 from 21 gives us 19, which we need another number to reach 85.
- Subtracting 2 from 66 gives us 64, then adding 21 gives us 85.
So, the equation would be 66 - 2 + 21 = 85.
</think>
<answer> 66 - 2 + 21 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list out the numbers we have: 33, 20, and 45. We need to create an equation that equals 32 using each number exactly once.
We can start trying combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
- Trying 33 - 20 - 45: This gives -12, which is not 32.
- Trying 33 - 20 + 45: This gives 58, which is not 32.
- Trying 45 - 33 - 20: This gives 2, which is not 32.
- Trying 45 - 20 - 33: This gives 2, which is not 32.
- Trying 33 + 20 - 45: This gives 8, which is not 32.
- Trying 45 + 20 - 33: This gives 32, which works!
So, we found that 45 + 20 - 33 = 32.
</think>
<answer> 45 + 20 - 33 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers 93, 6, and 53. We need to create an equation that results in 34 using each number only once and basic arithmetic operations.
- Adding or subtracting the smaller numbers (6 and 53) from 93 won't get us close to 34.
- Let's try subtracting 6 from 93 and then see if we can use 53 to reach 34.
93 - 6 = 87
Now we need 87 - 53 = 34, but using 53 in this subtraction would use it twice, which is not allowed.
- Let's try adding 6 and 53 first: 6 + 53 = 59.
- Now we need to get from 59 down to 34 by using 93, but we can't do that just by adding or subtracting from 59 with 93.
- Let's try another combination: 93 - (53 - 6) = 93 - 47 = 46.
- This is close but not 34. However, we can recalculate: 93 - (53 - 9) = 93 - 44 = 49.
- This is still not 34. We need to try a different combination.
- Let's try: (93 - 53) + 6 = 40 + 6 = 46.
- Still not 34. Let's try: (93 - 53) + (6 - 93/53) is not a valid operation.
- Finally, let's use: 93 - 53 + 6 - 93/53 : not a valid operation.
- Trying the option: 93 - (53 + 6) = 93 - 59 = 34.
This solution uses 53 + 6 = 59, then 93 - 59 = 34.
</think>
<answer> 93 - (53 + 6) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 93, 6, and 53. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations, to get the result of 34.
- If we look at the numbers, 93 + 53 = 146, which is far from 34.
- Subtraction of 93 - 53 = 40, which is still not 34.
- Combining 6 with others may be useful. If we consider 6 * 53 = 318, that's too high.
- Now, if we look at 93 - 53 = 40 and try to get to 34, we could write 40 - 6 * 53 = -314, which is not 34.
- Another combination is 6 + 53 = 59, close but not 34.
- If we consider 93 - 53 = 40 and then 40 - 6 = 34, we get the result.

<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 6, 26, and 36. We need to form an equation using each of these numbers exactly once to get the result of 68.
- Adding 6 and 26 gives 32.
- Then adding 36 to 32 gives 68.
So, the equation is 6 + 26 + 36.

<answer> 6 + 26 + 36 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 41, 85, and 93. We need to use each of these numbers exactly once to get a result of 49.
- Adding or subtracting the numbers individually won't work as they are close to 138 but not close enough to 49.
- Multiplying 41 by 85 gives 3485, which is much too large.
- Multiplying 93 by 85 gives 7905, which is also too large.
- Considering combinations like 41 + 85 = 126 and then trying to use 93 and 41 or 85 might not work as we are still far from 49.
- Let's try a combination such as 93 - 85 = 8 and then see if we can use 41 to reach 49: this would give 49 - 8 = 41, but 41 uses all the numbers and works.
So, 93 - 85 + 41 = 49.
</think>
<answer> 93 - 85 + 41 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 72, 35, and 45. We need to create an equation using these numbers only once, which equals 62. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- Trying to subtract or add/subtract the numbers directly from 72 doesn't get us close to 62.
- Multiplying and then adding/subtracting 35 or 45 might be useful.
If we multiply 72 and 45, we get 3240, which is far from 62.
Then, 72 - 45 = 27, and adding 35 gives us 27 + 35 = 62.
This seems to be the right combination.
</think>
<answer> 72 - 45 + 35 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list out the numbers we have: 2, 3, 3, and 96. We need to create an equation that equals 92 using these numbers only once.
We can start by checking if any combination of these numbers gives us 92. Let's try multiplying 3 and 3 to get 9, then see if we can use 2 and 96 to get 92. 96 - 2 = 94, which is close but not exactly 92. 
Now, let's try adding 96 and 3: 96 + 3 = 99, which is too high.
Next, let's try subtracting: 96 - 3 = 93. This is still not 92.
Now, let's try a different approach: 96 - 3 - 3 = 90. We are very close.
Finally, we see that 96 - 3 - 3 + 2 = 92, since 90 + 2 = 92.
</think>
<answer> 96 - 3 - 3 + 2 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 62, 19, and 73. We need to use each of these exactly once to create an equation that equals 30.
- Let's try combining 62 and 19: 62 - 19 = 43, which is far from 30.
- Now let's try combining 62 and 73: 62 + 73 = 135, which is also not 30.
- Let's then consider 73 - 62 = 11.
- Finally, let's see what happens if we take 30 and break it down: 30 = 73 - 43, but we don't have 43 directly available.
- Now, let's think about another approach: 30 = 73 - 43, also not working. 
- However, we can think of: 30 = 62 - 32, but 32 is not directly one of the numbers.
- Then consider: 30 = 73 - 43, but again, we need 43, which we don't have in a simpler combination involving the numbers 62, 19, and 73.
- Let’s evaluate: 30 = 62 - 32, again needing 32.
- In another way, we can consider: 30 = 73 - 19 - 62, but 19 + 62 = 81, not 73.
- Finally, let's try: 30 = 73 - 73 + 19 = 19. This is close, but not exactly 30.
- Now, a breakthrough might be: try 30 = 73 - (62 - 19) = 73 - 43 = 30.
</think>
<answer> 73 - (62 - 19) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 8, 18, and 1. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get 27.
We can start by looking at the target number, 27, and the numbers we have. One approach could be to try different combinations of operations between the numbers.
18 + 1 = 19 (which is close but not 27)
27 - 18 = 9 (which isn't directly possible with our numbers)
Then, let's try a different combination: 18 + 1 = 19, and then 19 + 8 = 27.
So, the equation should be 18 + 1 + 8 = 27.
</think>
<answer> 18 + 1 + 8 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers provided: 63, 58, and 20. We need to create an equation that equals 15 using these numbers exactly once and basic arithmetic operations.
- Adding 63 and 20 gives us 83.
- Subtracting 58 from 63 gives us 5.
- Subtracting 20 from 58 gives us 38.
- If we subtract 58 from 63 and then add 20, we get 63 - 58 + 20 = 25.
- If we add 58 and 20 and then subtract 63, we get 58 + 20 - 63 = 15.
So, combining 58 and 20 with subtraction and then adding 63 gives us 15.
</think>
<answer> 58 + 20 - 63 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we have the numbers 11, 73, and 73. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once with basic arithmetic operations that equals 11.
We can start by trying to add or subtract the numbers:
11 + 73 + 73 = 157 (too large)
11 + 73 - 73 = 11 (this could work)
11 - 73 + 73 = 11 (also works)
11 * 73 / 73 = 11 (this works, but we use each number only once)
11 / 73 + 73 = 73.18 (not 11)
From these combinations, we see that 11 + 73 - 73 = 11 works.
</think>
<answer> 11 + 73 - 73 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 34, 20, and 28. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to equal 14. One way to approach this is to think about subtraction or division that could lead us to 14.
- If we subtract 20 from 34, we get 14 (34 - 20 = 14).
- Now we only have 28 left and we need to incorporate this in a way that doesn't change our result. We know that 14 is what we're aiming for, and adding or multiplying 28 to 14 won't help us reach 14. So, we need to think about how 28 could relate to 14 in a suitable way.
- However, there isn't a straightforward way to combine 14 (our target) and 28 using basic arithmetic operations to get 14 again. Therefore, we need to reconsider our initial approach.
- Checking another combination: If we subtract 28 from 34, we get 6 (34 - 28 = 6), which doesn't work.
- Finally, let's consider adding 20 and 28 and then subtracting 34: (20 + 28) - 34 = 48 - 34 = 14. This gives us exactly what we want.
</think>
<answer> (20 + 28) - 34 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 14, 73, and 2. We need to create an equation that equals 85 using each number exactly once and basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try different combinations:
- 73 - 14 - 2 = 57 (too low)
- 73 - 14 + 2 = 61 (still too low)
- 73 + 14 - 2 = 85 (this looks promising)
- 73 + 14 + 2 = 89 (too high)
The combination 73 + 14 - 2 equals 85, using each number exactly once.
</think>
<answer> 73 + 14 - 2 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's evaluate the available numbers: 41, 74, and 1. We need to create an equation that equals 34 using these numbers exactly once.
- Subtracting 1 from 41 gives us 40.
- Now we need 10 less to get to 34, because 40 - 10 = 34.
- The only way to get 10 using the remaining number 74 (and the allowed operations) is to perform 74 - 64. However, 64 is not in our set.
- Instead, if we use 74 - 41, we get 33, which is close but not exactly 34.
- Another way could be 74 - 41 = 33, then 33 - 1 = 32, which is not 34.
- Finally, let's try: 41 - 74 + 1. This gives us -32, which is not what we want.
- Considering 1 * (74 - 41) gives us 33, which is close but not 34.
- Nothing seems to work directly. We might need to rethink with another approach. Another possibility is to use operations in a different order.
- Finally, 74 - 41 + 1 works: 74 - 41 = 33, and then adding 1 = 34.
</think>
<answer> 74 - 41 + 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list the given numbers: 83, 79, and 45. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get 49.
Let's try different combinations:
- We can't directly reach 49 using just addition and subtraction of these numbers.
- Multiplying 83 and 45 gives us 3,615, which is too large and won't help.
- 83 - 79 = 4, which is close but we need to get to 49.
- 79 - 83 = -4, which is too negative.
Let's try multiplication and subtraction:
- 83 * 45 = 3, 835, which is far from 49.
- If we try 79 * 45 = 3,555, we're still very far.
Since direct arithmetic operations between the given numbers don't work easily, let's think of combining them with another approach:
- 83 - 79 = 4. This gets us very close.
- Now, 4 + 45 = 49. This gives us the exact value we need.
Therefore, the equation is 83 - 79 + 45 = 49.
</think>
<answer> 83 - 79 + 45 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to create an equation using the numbers 75, 2, and 38 that equals 35. Let's start by looking at the numbers and thinking about possible operations:
- Adding or subtracting these numbers doesn't seem to get us close to 35.
- Multiplying 75 by any of the other numbers or dividing 35 by any of these numbers also doesn't seem to work.
- The only way to reach 35 using these numbers once is to use them in a combination that simplifies to 35.
Considering 75 + 2 = 77 and 77 - 38 = 39 which is close but not 35, let's try 75 - 38 - 2:
75 - 38 = 37
37 - 2 = 35
So, we have an equation that works: 75 - 38 - 2 = 35.
</think>
<answer> 75 - 38 - 2 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 21, 18, and 38. We need to create an equation that equals 35 using each number exactly once.
Let's start by adding 21 and 18:
21 + 18 = 39
Now, we need a way to get from 39 to 35. We can subtract 4 from 39 to get 35:
39 - 4 = 35
Now, we need to get 4 using the number 38. We can divide 38 by 9 to get 4 (though 9 is not in the list of numbers, we could consider the integer part of 38/38 = 1 but that is not useful here).
So, we can express 4 as 38/9, but since we can't actually divide by a non-integer as per these numbers, we'll stick with the subtraction approach considering the available numbers.
Therefore, the equation becomes:
21 + 18 - 38/9 = 35
However, since we need to stick to the integers and the problem is simplified around using operations with the numbers given, we realize that there's no direct way to get 35 using only the integers 21, 18, and 38 without introducing additional operations or numbers outside our set.
So, we need to compensate with another approach:
(38 - 21) + 18 = 17 + 18 = 35
This way, we use subtraction and addition to get the desired result of 35.
</think>
<answer> (38 - 21) + 18 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers available: 25, 76, 9, and 19. We need to create an equation that equals 61 using each number only once and basic arithmetic operations.
- One way to approach this is to see if any combination of the numbers, when added or subtracted, can approach 61.
- Adding and subtracting the numbers directly: \(25 + 76 + 9 + 19 = 139 \) which is too high.
- Another approach is to try different combinations, like 76 + 19 - 25 - 9, but this gives \(76 + 19 - 25 - 9 = 61\), which equals our target.
- This combination uses each number exactly once and results in 61.
</think>
<answer> 76 + 19 - 25 - 9 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to use the numbers 67, 60, and 85 exactly once to get 78. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
- 85 - 67 = 18, and 60 + 18 = 78, but we used the operations twice.
- 85 - 60 = 25, and 25 + 67 = 92, which doesn't work.
- 85 - 67 = 18, and 60 + 18 = 78, which is not valid since we can't use the same number twice.
- 85 - 60 = 25, and 67 - 25 = 42, which is not 78.
- 67 + 60 = 127, which is too high and we can't use 85 this way.
- Let's try 67 + 60 - 85 = 42, which is not 78.
Since we haven't found a combination using the numbers once that gives us 78, let's re-evaluate another way with different operations:
- 67 - (85 - 60) = 67 - 25 = 42, which is not 78.
- 67 + (85 - 60) = 67 + 25 = 92, which is not 78.
- 60 + (85 - 67) = 60 + 18 = 78, which gives us 78.
So, we have 60 + (85 - 67) = 78.
</think>
<answer> 60 + (85 - 67) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's examine the numbers we have: 67, 60, and 85. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 78.
- Let's try combinations: 67 + 60 - 85 = 107 - 85 = 22 (not 78)
- Let's try another combination: 85 + 60 - 67 = 145 - 67 = 78 (this works)
So, the equation that equals 78 using the numbers 67, 60, and 85 is 85 + 60 - 67.
</think>
<answer> 85 + 60 - 67 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers provided: 8, 16, and 97. We need to use these numbers exactly once and combine them using basic arithmetic operations to get 73.
- Adding 8 and 16 gives us 24.
- Adding this sum (24) to 97 gives us 121.
- Clearly, 121 is not 73.
- Let's try subtracting 97 from 16 first: this gives us -83.
- Adding 8 to -83 gives us -75, which is not 73.
- Next, let's try 97 - 16 = 81.
- Then, subtracting 8 from 81 gives us 73.
Thus, we have used the numbers as 97 - 16 - 8 = 73.
</think>
<answer> 97 - 16 - 8 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider all the possible combinations of the numbers 33, 62, 65, and 76 using basic arithmetic operations to see if we can get to 40. We can add, subtract, multiply, or divide the numbers, but each number can only be used once.
- 33 + 62 = 95 (too high)
- 33 + 65 = 98 (too high)
- 33 + 76 = 109 (too high)
- 62 + 65 = 127 (too high)
- 62 + 76 = 138 (too high)
- 65 + 76 = 141 (too high)
- 33 - 62 = -29 (too low)
- 33 - 65 = -32 (too low)
- 33 - 76 = -43 (too low)
- 62 - 65 = -3 (too low)
- 62 - 76 = -14 (too low)
- 65 - 76 = -11 (too low)
- 33 * 62 = 2046 (way too high)
- 33 * 65 = 2145 (way too high)
- 33 * 76 = 2448 (way too high)
- 62 * 65 = 4030 (way too high)
- 62 * 76 = 4632 (way too high)
- 65 * 76 = 4940 (way too high)
- 33 / 62 = 0.53 (too low)
- 33 / 65 = 0.51 (too low)
- 33 / 76 = 0.43 (too low)
- 62 / 65 = 0.95 (too low)
- 62 / 76 = 0.81 (too low)
- 65 / 76 = 0.85 (too low)
Ok, it seems adding or subtracting these numbers won't work out close to 40. Let's try a different approach:
- 76 - 65 + 33 = 44 (too high)
- 76 - 65 + 62 = 73 (too high)
- 76 - 62 + 33 = 47 (too high)
- 65 - 62 + 76 = 80 (too high)
- 65 - 76 + 33 = 22 (too low)
Now, let's try 76 - 65 - 33 = 2 and add 62:
- 76 - 65 - 33 + 62 = 40
</think>
<answer> 76 - 65 - 33 + 62 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 35, 83, 6, and 12. We need to use these exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 24.
- Adding or subtracting the numbers doesn't seem to bring us close to 24.
- Multiplying and dividing might be more promising.
Looking at the numbers, 83 - 35 = 48 is a significant difference. Now if we divide 48 by 2, we get 24. But we don't have a 2. However, we can use 12 and 6 to make a 2, because 12 / 6 = 2.
So, the equation becomes: (83 - 35) / (12 / 6) = 24.
</think>
<answer> (83 - 35) / (12 / 6) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 55, 16, and 26. We need to use each of these exactly once to make the equation equal 97.
One way to approach this is to think about combinations of addition and subtraction that could get us close to 97 from these numbers.
If we add 55 and 26, we get 81. To reach 97 from 81, we need an additional 16. This means we can use 55 + 26 + 16 = 97.
</think>
<answer> 55 + 26 + 16 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 90, 34, and 31 that equals 25. Let's try combining these numbers with basic arithmetic operations.
- One way to approach this is to consider if there's a way to get close to 25 using just two of the numbers, and then adjust with the third.
- 31 - 34 = -3, but this is not close to 25.
- Adding 31 + 34 = 65, which is too high.
- Let's try 90 - 34 = 56, which is also not right.
- Now, let's try the combination 90 - 31 = 59.
- Finally, 59 - 34 = 25, which is exactly what we need.
So, the equation is (90 - 31) - 34 = 25.
</think>
<answer> (90 - 31) - 34 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list out the numbers we have: 35, 58, and 16. We need to create an equation that results in 39 using each of these numbers exactly once.
We can start by looking at the target number and the numbers we have. One approach is to see if combining two numbers and then using the third can give us 39.
58 - 16 = 42 is close but too high.
35 + 58 = 93 is too high.
35 + 16 = 51 is also too high.
Now let's try 58 - 35 = 23. We are not there yet, but we can see that 39 - 23 = 16, and we already have 16.
So the equation becomes: 58 - 35 + 16 = 39.
</think>
<answer> 58 - 35 + 16 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 96, 60, and 42. We need to create an equation that equals 78 using each number only once.
We can try combining the numbers in different ways with operations:
- Adding or subtracting the numbers in different orders
- Multiplying or dividing the numbers
Let's try 96 - 60 + 42:
96 - 60 + 42 = 36 + 42 = 78
This gives us the desired result of 78 using all three numbers once.
</think>
<answer> 96 - 60 + 42 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 65, 31, and 11. We need to create an equation that equals 45 using each number exactly once.
One approach is to try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Let's try: 65 - 31 + 11
65 - 31 = 34
34 + 11 = 45
This gives us the result we want. So the equation is 65 - 31 + 11 = 45.
</think>
<answer> 65 - 31 + 11 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 65, 31, and 11. We need to create an equation that equals 45 using each number exactly once.
- Start by noticing that 65 - 31 = 34, which is close to 45 but not exactly there.
- Adding 11 to 34 gives us 45 (34 + 11 = 45).
- So, the equation using the numbers 65, 31, and 11 that equals 45 is 65 - 31 + 11.
</think>
<answer> 65 - 31 + 11 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to use the numbers 16, 82, and 13 exactly once to get 53. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Trying 82 - 16 - 13: This gives 53. This seems to work.
So, the equation would be 82 - 16 - 13 = 53.
</think>
<answer> 82 - 16 - 13 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 27, 53, 69, and 58. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once that equals 47.
One way to approach this is to try operations and combinations. Let's start by looking at the possible differences:
- 53 - 27 = 26 (not 47)
- 69 - 53 = 16 (not 47)
- 69 - 27 = 42 (not 47)
- 58 - 27 = 31 (not 47)
- 58 - 53 = 5 (not 47)
So, these differences don't work. Let's try adding some numbers:
- 27 + 53 = 80 (not 47)
- 27 + 58 = 85 (not 47)
- 53 + 58 = 111 (not 47)
- 27 + 53 + 58 = 138 (not 47)
- 27 + 53 + 58 - 69 = 69 - 69 = 0 (not 47)
Let's try mixing operations:
- (69 - 58) + 27 = 11 + 27 = 38 (not 47)
- (58 - 53) + 27 = 5 + 27 = 32 (not 47)
- 58 + (69 - 27) = 58 + 42 = 100 (not 47)
- (58 + 27) - 69 = 85 - 69 = 16 (not 47)
From the above, none of these work. Let's try:
- (69 - 27) + 53 = 42 + 53 = 95 (not 47)
Finally, let's try:
- 27 + (58 - 53) = 27 + 5 = 32 (not 47)
I realize that I need to recheck combinations more carefully:
- (69 - 53) + 27 = 16 + 27 = 43 (not 47)
One valid operation:
- 27 + (58 - 53) = 27 + 5 = 32 (not 47)
So, I realize the critical mistake: the correct operation is:
- 58 - 27 - 53 + 69 = 31 - 53 + 69 = -22 + 69 = 47
</think>
<answer> 58 - 27 - 53 + 69 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list the numbers we have: 91, 41, 17, and 56. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once to equal 59.
- Start by subtracting smaller numbers from larger ones to see if we can get closer to 59.
- If we subtract 17 from 91, we get 74.
- Now we need to get from 74 to 59 by using 41 and 56.
- Subtracting 41 from 74 leaves us with 33.
- Finally, adding 56 to 33 gives us 93, which is too much.
- Let's try another combination: subtracting 56 from 91 leaves us with 35.
- Now we need to get from 35 to 59 by using 41.
- Adding 41 to 35 gives us 76, which is too much.
- Let's try subtracting 41 from 56, which leaves us with 15.
- Finally, adding 35 (obtained by 91 - 56) to 15 gives us 50, which is still not 59.
- We realize we might need to use the numbers in a different way. Let's try 56 + 41 - 91 + 17:
- 56 + 41 = 97
- 97 - 91 = 6
- 6 + 17 = 23, which is not 59.
- Let's try another approach: 91 - 56 = 35, then 35 + 41 = 76, which is too much.
- Now, let's use 91 - 41 = 50. Then we need to adjust to 59. Adding 17 to 50 is 67, and adding another number, we need 3 more to reach 59, so adding 17 one more time would give us 84, not 59.
- Finally, let's try 91 - 56 = 35, then adding 41 gives us 76, which is too much. Let me adjust: we need to use the numbers 91 - 35 (which is obtained by 91 - 41) and then add another number.
- 91 - 41 = 50, and we need 59 more. So, 50 + 19 won't work because we don't have 19. Instead, we can try 91 - 41 = 50, then adding 17 to get 67, and we need 32 more to reach 59, not possible with 56. Another combination would be 56 + 41 = 97, then subtracting 35, which is 97 - 56 - 41 = 97 - 97 = 0, which is not correct.
- Finally, a correct combination: 91 - 56 = 35, then 35 + 41 - 17 = 59.
</think>
<answer> (91 - 56) + 41 - 17 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 11, 26, 93, and 84. We need to use each once and combine them with basic arithmetic to get 24.
We can notice that 93 - 84 = 9. Now we need to combine 11 and 26 to make 15 (since 9 + 15 = 24).
However, 11 + 26 = 37, which is too high. 11 + 26 = 37, then 93 - 84 + 11 + 26 doesn't work.
Let's try another approach: 26 - 11 = 15 (this gives us part of what we need, 9 + 15 = 24).
So combining the parts: 93 - 84 + 11 + 26 should be tested.
93 - 84 = 9, then 9 + 11 + 26 = 46 (too high).
This isn't working, so let's try doing the multiplication and division part first: 26 * (93 / 84) = 26 * 0. 11. 0857... (which is not an integer, so not possible).
Another way could be to try 26 - 11 + (93 - 84) = 26 - 11 + 9 = 24.
This works, so our equation is 26 - 11 + (93 - 84) = 24.
</think>
<answer> 26 - 11 + (93 - 84) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 11, 26, 93, and 84. We need to use these numbers exactly once to get 24.
One approach could be combining 26 and 84 to get 110, and then working with 11. We know that 110 - 86 = 24, but 86 is not among our numbers.
Another possibility is to look for a combination that directly uses 26, 11, and 11's combinations to form 24.
Let's try these steps:
1) 26 - 11 = 15
2) Then we need 9 more to reach 24.
3) 15 + 9 = 24
But we only have 93 and 84 left, and no ways to get 9 directly using these numbers.
Instead, let's combine: 26 + (93 - 84) = 26 + 9 = 32
Now, we need 4 less to reach 24, which is not possible with the remaining numbers.
Let's try 93 + 26 - (11 + 84):
1) 93 + 26 = 119
2) 119 - (11 + 84) = 119 - 95 = 24
This works!
</think>
<answer> 93 + 26 - (11 + 84) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 99, 51, and 28. We need to use each number exactly once to get a result of 76.
We can start by looking at the operations we have: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/).
Let's try combinations:
99 + 51 + 28 = 178 (too high)
99 + 51 - 28 = 122 (still too high)
99 + 28 - 51 = 76 (this looks promising)
51 - 28 + 99 = 122 (too high)
28 + 51 - 99 = -18 (too low)
So, 99 + 28 - 51 does indeed give us 76.
</think>
<answer> 99 + 28 - 51 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 22, 98, and 60. We need to create an equation that equals 16 using each number exactly once.
- Trying basic addition: 22 + 98 + 60 = 180, which is too high.
- Trying subtraction: 98 - 22 - 60 = 16. This seems promising as it uses all numbers.
So, the equation 98 - 22 - 60 equals 16. </think>
<answer> 98 - 22 - 60 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 22, 98, and 60. We need to use each exactly once and combine them using basic arithmetic operations to get 16.
- Adding or subtracting the numbers doesn't seem likely to reach 16.
- Multiplying or dividing by 22, 98, or 60 doesn't work either, as the results are far from 16.
- Let's try combining them in a different way: (98 - 60) + 22.
  - This gives us 38 + 22, which is not 16.
- Now let's try: 98 - (60 + 22).
  - This simplifies to 98 - 82, which is 16.
  - This combination works as it uses each number exactly once and follows the required arithmetic operation sequence.
</think>
<answer> 98 - (60 + 22) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 22, 98, and 60. We need to create an equation that uses these numbers exactly once to get the result of 16.
- One quick check shows that none of the numbers alone is close to 16, so we'll need to combine them with operations.
- Adding the numbers: 22 + 98 + 60 = 180, which isn't 16.
- Subtracting: 98 - 60 - 22 = 16, which is our target result.
So, the equation using the numbers once each is 98 - 60 - 22 = 16.
</think>
<answer> 98 - 60 - 22 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list the numbers we have: 41, 38, and 88. We need to form an equation that equals 91 using these numbers exactly once.
We can start by looking at the target number and the numbers we have:
91 - 41 = 50
We now have 38 and 88 left, and 50 is not the target yet. Next, let's try:
88 - 38 = 50
Now we have 50, which when added to 41 gives us:
41 + 50 = 91
So the equation is:
88 - 38 + 41 = 91
</think>
<answer> 88 - 38 + 41 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 41, 38, and 88. We need to use these once each to make 91.
We can start by adding and subtracting these numbers to see if we can get close to 91.
If we subtract 38 from 41, we get 7. Then if we add 88 to this result, we get:
7 + 88 = 95, which is too high.
Let's try another combination: If we add 41 and 38, we get 79. Then if we add 88 to this result, we get:
79 + 88 = 167, which is too high.
Now let's try: If we add 88 and 41, we get 129. Then if we subtract 38 from this result, we get:
129 - 38 = 91, which is exactly what we need.
So, the equation that uses the numbers 41, 38, 88 exactly once to make 91 is 88 + 41 - 38 = 91.
</think>
<answer> 88 + 41 - 38 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 41, 38, and 88. We need to create an equation that equals 91 using each of these numbers only once.
We can start by looking at the differences and sums of these numbers:
- 88 - 38 = 50
- 41 - 50 = -9 (which isn't helpful)
- 88 + 41 = 129
- 129 - 38 = 91
So, we can see that 88 + 41 - 38 = 91.
</think>
<answer> 88 + 41 - 38 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 24, 39, and 12. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 51.
- Adding the numbers: 24 + 39 + 12 = 75 (which is too high)
- Subtracting 12 from 39: 39 - 12 = 27, and then adding 24: 27 + 24 = 51 (this works)
So, the equation that uses the numbers 24, 39, and 12 exactly once and equals 51 is 39 - 12 + 24.
</think>
<answer> 39 - 12 + 24 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 24, 39, and 12. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations, to get a result of 51.
- Adding the numbers: 24 + 39 + 12 = 75, which is too high.
- Subtracting the numbers: There's no combination that works, as 24 - 39 - 12 = -27.
- Multiplying the numbers: 24 * 39 * 12, which is a large number and would be much too big.
- Dividing the numbers: There's no straightforward division operation that will give us 51.
Now let's consider combining operations:
- 39 - 24 + 12 = 15, which is too low.
- 24 + 39 - 12 = 51, which looks promising.
24 + 39 - 12 equals 51, which is our target.
</think>
<answer> 24 + 39 - 12 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 34, 42, and 92. We need to use each exactly once and combine them using basic arithmetic operations to get 100.
We can start by looking at the total we need to reach: 100.
One way to approach this is to try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Let's try: (92 + 42) - 34
92 + 42 = 134
134 - 34 = 100
This gives us the desired result of 100 using all three numbers exactly once.
</think>
<answer>(92 + 42) - 34</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 13, 14, and 95. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once that equals 94.
- We can try combining the numbers directly or try adding, subtracting, or multiplying them in various ways.
- Let's start by trying to see if we can get closer to 94 by adding and subtracting the numbers:
  - 14 + 13 = 27 (which is not 94)
  - 14 + 13 - 95 = -68 (which is not 94)
  - 13 + 14 + 95 = 122 (which is not 94)
  - Now let's try different combinations:
  - 95 - 14 - 13 = 68 (which is not 94)
  - However, 95 - 14 + 13 = 94 (which is 94, this seems to work)
  - We've found the correct combination: 95 - 14 + 13 = 94.
</think>
<answer> 95 - 14 + 13 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the given numbers: 13, 14, and 95. We need to create an equation that equals 94 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
- Starting with the largest number, 95, we can subtract 14 to get 81.
- Then, we need to get from 81 to 94 using the remaining number, 13.
- If we add 13 to 81, we get 94.
So the equation is: 95 - 14 + 13 = 94.
</think>
<answer> 95 - 14 + 13 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 38, 65, and 88. We need to use these numbers exactly once to make the equation equal to 61.
We can try different combinations using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- If we add 38 and 65, we get 103, which is too high.
- If we subtract 38 from 65, we get 27, which is not 61.
- If we subtract 65 from 88, we get 23, which is not 61.
- If we add 38 and 88, we get 123, which is too high.
- If we subtract 88 from 65, we get -23, which is not 61.
- If we subtract 88 from 38, we get -50, which is not 61.
- Let's try multiplying 38 by 65: 38 * 65 = 2470, which is too high.
- Let's try 65 * 88 / 65 = 88, which is not 61.
- Now, let's try a different combination: (88 - 65) + 38 = 23 + 38 = 61, which is the target number.
</think>
<answer> (88 - 65) + 38 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list out the numbers we have: 61, 14, and 24. We need to create an equation that equals 51 using each number only once and basic arithmetic operations.
- Adding or subtracting the largest number (61) won't work because it's too large.
- Subtracting 24 from 61 gives us 37, which is not 51.
- Adding 14 to 24 gives us 38, which is not 51 either.
- Now let's try combining operations: 
  - 61 - 24 + 14 = 51
This equation uses all numbers exactly once and equals 51.
</think>
<answer> 61 - 24 + 14 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 62, 81, 30, and 2. We need to create an equation that equals 51 using each number exactly once.
Let's try combining smaller numbers first: 62 - 81 = -19. This is not helpful directly.
Next, let's try 81 - 62 = 19. Now we have 19, 30, and 2 left. 
19 + 30 = 49. This is close to 51, but we need 2 more.
Adding 2 to 49 gives us 51. 
So, the equation becomes: 81 - 62 + 30 + 2 = 51.
</think>
<answer> 81 - 62 + 30 + 2 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 62, 81, 30, and 2. We need to create an equation that equals 51 using each number exactly once.
We can start by trying to combine the numbers in different ways. One effective strategy is to try to form the number 51 using addition and subtraction with these numbers.
Notice that 62 - 81 = -19, 81 - 62 = 19, 30 - 2 = 28, and 62 + 30 = 92. None of these combinations directly lead to 51.
Instead, let's try 81 - 30 + 2 - 62:
81 - 30 = 51
51 + 2 = 53
53 - 62 = 1
This doesn't work as the final result is 1, not 51.
We need to adjust slightly. Let's try 81 - 62 + 30 - 2:
81 - 62 = 19
19 + 30 = 49
49 - 2 = 47
This is still not 51. 
Now let's try 81 + 30 - 62 - 2:
81 + 30 = 111
111 - 62 = 49
49 - 2 = 47
This is still not 51.
We've tried a few combinations. Let's try 62 + 30 - 81 - 2:
62 + 30 = 92
92 - 81 = 11
11 - 2 = 9
This is still not 51.
It seems none of the combinations of basic arithmetic yield 51. However, there might be another combination not tested.
Finally, after rechecking possibilities and combinations, we realize:
2 + 30 + 81 - 62 = 51.
This checks out:
2 + 30 = 32
32 + 81 = 113
113 - 62 = 51.
</think>
<answer> 2 + 30 + 81 - 62 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 1, 91, and 30. We need to create an equation that equals 60 using each number exactly once and basic arithmetic operations.
- Adding 1 and 30 gives us 31.
- Now, we need an additional 29 to reach 60.
- Notice that 91 - 62 = -21, but we need 29.
- Instead, let's try 91 - 30 and then add 1.
- This gives us 91 - 30 + 1 = 61, which is too high.
- Let's try a different combination: 91 - 30 - 1.
- This gives us 91 - 30 - 1 = 60.
Thus, the equation is 91 - 30 - 1 = 60.
</think>
<answer> 91 - 30 - 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 1, 91, and 30. We need to use these numbers exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get a result of 60.
One way to approach this is to look for a combination of operations that could lead us to 60. We can try combining the numbers in different ways.
If we add 30 and 91, we get 121. If we subtract 1 from this sum (121 - 1 = 120), we're very close to 60. However, 120 is not what we want.
Now let's try another approach: 91 - 30 = 61. Then, if we add 1 (from the original 1) to 61, we get 62, which is still not 60.
Another straightforward approach is to use the multiplication and subtraction: 91 * 30 / 1. This would give us 91 * 30 = 2730, and then 2730 / 1 = 2730, which is not 60 either.
Since none of the straightforward combinations worked, let's consider a simpler combination: 91 - 30 - 1. This gives us 60 exactly.
So the equation is 91 - 30 - 1 = 60.
</think>
<answer> 91 - 30 - 1 </answer>

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 31, 64, and 24. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get a result of 71.
- Adding the numbers: 31 + 64 + 24 = 119 (which is not 71)
- Subtracting: 64 - 31 - 24 = 9 (which is not 71)
- Multiplying and adding/subtracting: We can try 64 - 31 + 24 but that gives 57 (not 71).
- Now let's try: 64 + 24 - 31 = 57 (which is still not 71).
- Let's try a different combination: 64 + 31 - 24 = 71 (this yields the desired result).
So, the correct equation using the numbers 31, 64, and 24 is 64 + 31 - 24 = 71.
</think>
<answer> 64 + 31 - 24 </answer>

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 87, 21, and 28. We need to create an equation that equals 38 using these numbers exactly once.
We can start by looking at the possible combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- 87 - 21 - 28 = 38
Let's verify this:
87 - 21 = 66
66 - 28 = 38
This calculation is correct, and it uses all three numbers exactly once.
</think>
<answer> 87 - 21 - 28 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 69, 25, 35, and 47. We need to create an equation that equals 82 using each number exactly once.
- Adding the first two numbers: 69 + 25 = 94
- Subtracting the third number from this sum: 94 - 35 = 59
- Adding the last number to this result: 59 + 47 = 106
This doesn't give us 82, so this combination isn't correct.
- Let's try subtracting the second number from the first: 69 - 25 = 44
- Adding the third number to this result: 44 + 35 = 79
- Adding the fourth number to this result: 79 + 47 = 126
This also doesn't give 82.
- Let's try multiplying the first and second numbers: 69 * 25 = 1725
- This is far too large, so let's try another combination.
- Let's try subtracting the third number from the second: 25 - 35 = -10
- Adding the first number to this result: 69 - 10 = 59
- Adding the fourth number to this result: 59 + 47 = 106
This still doesn't give us 82.
- Let's try adding the third number to the second: 25 + 35 = 60
- Subtracting the first number from this result: 60 - 69 = -9
- Adding the fourth number to this result: -9 + 47 = 38
This is still not 82.
- Let's try subtracting the fourth number from the first: 69 - 47 = 22
- Adding the second number to this result: 22 + 25 = 47
- Adding the third number to this result: 47 + 35 = 82
This gives us the desired result of 82.

<answer> 69 - 47 + 25 + 35 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 51, 10, and 8. We need to use each number exactly once and any combination of the operations +, -, *, / to make the equation equal 53.
- If we try to add or subtract, we'll quickly realize that any combination of these three numbers won't reach 53.
- Multiplying 51 by any of the others will result in a number too large (510 or 408), or too small (5 or 8), which we can't adjust to get 53.
- Therefore, we need to look at division.
- If we divide 51 by 10, we get 5.1, which is close but not 53.
- If we then add 8 to 5. 1, we get 13. 1, which is still far from 53.
- Instead, let's try dividing 51 by 8 first. This gives us 6. 375, which is not an integer and won't help.
- Now let's try a different combination: dividing 51 by 10 gives 5. 1, and then adding 8 to it gives 13. 1. This is not 53.
- Finally, let's try a combination of subtraction: if we subtract 10 from 51, we get 41, and then adding 8 to this result gives 49. This is still not 53.
- The only option left is to use 51 - 10 and then divide by 8. This gives us 41 / 8 = 5. 125, which is not 53.
- Since none of the above combinations work, it seems like an oversight. However, looking at the options carefully, we see that using 51 - (10 + 8) gives 51 - 18 = 33, which is not 53.
- The only viable combination left is: (51 - 10) + 8 = 48 + 8 = 56, which is too high.
- Trying a potential oversight, using (51 - 8) + 10 = 43 + 10 = 53, we get 53 exactly.
</think>
<answer> (51 - 8) + 10 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 51, 10, and 8. We need to use these exactly once to get an equation that equals 53.
We can start by trying different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- If we try 51 + 10 + 8, we don't get 53.
- Trying 51 + 10 - 8 = 53, which matches our target.
So, the equation using the numbers 51, 10, and 8 that equals 53 is 51 + 10 - 8.
</think>
<answer> 51 + 10 - 8 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 51, 10, and 8 that equals 53. I'll start by considering simple operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Adding 51 and 10 gives 61, which is too high.
- Subtracting 10 from 51 gives 41, which is closer but still too low.
- Subtracting 8 from 51 gives 43, which is also too low.
- Multiplying 10 by 8 gives 80, which is not useful here.
- Dividing 51 by 10 gives 5.1, which is not an integer and doesn't fit.
- Adding 10 and 8 gives 18, which when subtracted from 51 gives 33, still not 53.
- The combination that might work is 51 minus 10 and then adding 8. But 51 - 10 = 41, and then adding 8 would give 49, not 53.
Given the above combinations, subtracting 10 and 8 from 51, gives 33, which is far from 53. This approach doesn't seem to work with these three numbers directly. I'll re-evaluate by considering all possible pairings:
- If we take 51 - 10 + 8, it becomes 49.
- If we take 51 - 8 + 10, it becomes 53.
Thus, the correct equation is 51 - 8 + 10 = 53.

<answer> 51 - 8 + 10 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 5, 6, and 64. We need to create an equation that equals 65 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by adding 64 and 6 which gives us 70. Then, we need to get from 70 to 65, which means we need to subtract 5.
So, the equation would be: 64 + 6 - 5 = 65.
</think>
<answer> 64 + 6 - 5 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 56, 16, and 28. We need to create an equation that equals 18 using each number once and only basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by checking if we can combine any two of these numbers to get a value close to 18.
56 - 16 = 40
This is too high. Let's try another combination:
56 - 28 = 28
This is also too high. Now let's try:
16 + 28 = 44
This is also too high. Finally, let's try:
56 - 16 - 28 = 12
This is still not 18. Now let's look at different combinations again:
56 + 16 - 28 = 44 - 28 = 16
This is close but not 18. It seems adding and subtracting directly might not work. Let's try:
(56 - 16) / 28 = 40 / 28 = 1. 428571...
This is not an integer close to 18. Let's simplify further:
56 / 28 + 16 = 2 + 16 = 18
This gives us the result we need. So, the equation is 56 / 28 + 16 = 18.
</think>
<answer> 56 / 28 + 16 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list out the numbers we have: 71, 56, and 84. We need to use these once each to get a result of 99.
We can start by adding 71 and 56:
71 + 56 = 127
Now we need to reduce this sum to 99 using the third number, 84.
We can subtract 84 from 127:
127 - 84 = 43
But 43 is still not 99. We need to get closer. Let's try another combination. Instead, let's try using the operations to get to 99 directly. We know:
84 - 56 = 28
Now we need to get from 28 to 99 using 71. We can add 71 to 28:
28 + 71 = 99
So we have our equation: 84 - 56 + 71 = 99.
</think>
<answer> 84 - 56 + 71 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to create an equation that uses the numbers 17, 24, and 17 exactly once, with the operations +, -, *, and /. Looking at the numbers, we can see that 24 is already close to 17, which might be our starting point.
(17 + 17) = 34, but this doesn't use 24 correctly.
We need to introduce 24 somehow. If we subtract 17 from 24, we get 7. Now, we have two 17s and a 7.
17 - 7 = 10
Now we have 17, 17, and 10. We need to get to 24. Adding 17 to 10 gives us 27, which is too high. Instead, we should divide 17 by 10, but this doesn't give us a whole number.
Instead, let's try a different approach: 24 - 17 + 17 = 24.
This uses all numbers exactly once and the correct operations to equal 24.
</think>
<answer> 24 - 17 + 17 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 92, 13, 23, and 21. We need to create an equation that equals 77 using each number only once.
We can start by looking at 92 - 13 = 79, which is close to 77 but not quite there.
Next, consider 92 - 13 - 23 = 56, still not 77.
Adding 21 to 56 gives us 77.
So the equation would be 92 - 13 - 23 + 21 = 77.
</think>
<answer> 92 - 13 - 23 + 21 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers 13, 14, and 95. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 94.
- We can try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- If we look at 95 - 14 = 81, which is close but not 94.
- If we subtract 13 instead, we get 95 - 13 = 82, still not 94.
- Now, if we take 95 - 13 - 14 = 88, which is still not the target.
- Let's try 14 + 13 = 27 and then subtract 95 - 27 = 68, obviously not it.
- Finally, let's try 95 - 14 - 13 = 68 and subtract again 13 = 55, far from 94.
- Now let's check 14 + 95 - 13 = 96 - 13 = 83 - not good.
- But if we try 95 - 14 + 13 = 81 + 13 = 94, we have found the correct combination.
</think>
<answer> 95 - 14 + 13 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 13, 14, and 95. We need to create an equation that equals 94 using each number exactly once.
We can try different combinations of operations. Let's start with subtraction and addition:
- 95 - 14 - 13 = 68 (too high)
- 95 - 14 + 13 = 94 (this looks promising)
We see that 95 - 14 + 13 gives us 94. This uses all the numbers exactly once and satisfies the condition.
</think>
<answer> 95 - 14 + 13 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 21, 84, and 3. We need to create an equation that uses these numbers exactly once and results in 49.
One approach is to look at the operations we can use: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. We should try different combinations.
Let's try multiplication and subtraction:
84 * 3 = 252
252 + 21 = 273
This does not give us 49.
Now, let's try another combination involving 21 and 3:
3 + 21 = 24
84 - 24 = 60
This also doesn't give us 49.
Let's try dividing:
84 / 3 = 28
21 + 28 = 49
This combination results in 49.
So, the equation is 84 / 3 + 21 = 49.
</think>
<answer> 84 / 3 + 21 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 21, 84, and 3. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once that equals 49.
- One way to approach this is to try different combinations of operations.
- Let's try multiplication and subtraction: 84 / 3 = 28, and then 28 - 21 = 7. This doesn't give us 49.
- Next, let's try multiplication and addition: 21 * 3 = 63, and then 63 - 84 = -11. This also doesn't work.
- Now, let's try addition and subtraction: 84 + 21 = 105, and then 105 - 3 = 102. This is not 49 either.
- One missing combination is to use 21 + (84 / 3). This gives us 21 + 28 = 49.
- Therefore, the equation is 21 + (84 / 3) = 49.
</think>
<answer> 21 + (84 / 3) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 45, 20, and 12. We need to create an equation that equals 13 using each number exactly once.
- Let's start by looking at the target number, 13, and think about what we can do with the given numbers.
- 13 is close to 12, so let's consider using 12 as it is. This leaves us with 45 and 20 to work with.
- We need to get from 45 and 20 to 1. One way to do this is to subtract 20 from 45.
- So, 45 - 20 = 25.
- Now we have 25 - 12 = 13.
Therefore, the equation is 45 - 20 - 12 = 13.
</think>
<answer> 45 - 20 - 12 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 51, 28, and 28. We need to use each number exactly once and combine them using basic arithmetic operations to get 51.
We can start by looking at the target number, 51. Notice that 28 + 28 equals 56, which is close to 51 but too high. If we subtract 5 from 56, we get 51. Now, we need to use 51 to combine with the 28's. The number 5 can be formed by subtracting 28 from 51. So, we can write:
51 - (28 - 28) = 51
This equation uses each number exactly once and follows the rule of basic arithmetic operations. </think>
<answer> 51 - (28 - 28) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's examine the numbers we have: 46, 42, and 12. We need to create an equation that equals 76 using each of these numbers exactly once.
We can start by adding 46 and 42, which gives us 88. However, 88 is too high for our target of 76, so we need to subtract something from it.
If we subtract 12 from 88, we get:
88 - 12 = 76
This gives us the equation: 46 + 42 - 12 = 76.
</think>
<answer> 46 + 42 - 12 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 86, 15, and 2 that equals 73. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- 86 + 15 + 2 = 103 (This is too high)
- 86 + 15 - 2 = 99 (This is too high)
- 86 + 15 / 2 = 98.5 (This is not an integer and too high)
- 86 - 15 + 2 = 73 (This looks promising)
- 86 - 15 / 2 = 78.5 (This is not an integer and too high)
- 86 / 15 + 2 = 6.1333... (This is not an integer and too low)
So, the combination 86 - 15 + 2 equals 73. Therefore, the equation is 86 - 15 + 2 = 73.
</think>
<answer> 86 - 15 + 2 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 51, 63, and 68. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once that equals 46.
- Start by looking at the numbers themselves: 51 is close to 46, but subtracting 51 or 63 or 68 won't give us 46.
- Now, consider adding the numbers: 51 + 63 = 114, which is too large.
- Let's try 68 + 51: This equals 119, also too large.
- Now let's look at possible combinations of operations: 68 - 51 = 17, which isn't 46 either.
- Consider another possibility: 68 - 51 - 63 or 68 - 51 + 63 or similar.
- The combination 68 - 51 - 63 equals 68 - 51 - 63 = 15, still not 46.
- Let's try 68 - (51 + 63), that equals 68 - 114, which is -46, not what we need.
- Finally, let's try 68 - (51 - 63), which equals 68 - (-12) = 68 + 12 = 80, still not 46.
- Trying 63 - (51 - 68) might give a closer result, 63 - (51 - 68) equals 63 + 17 = 80, still too high.
- Realizing we are close to a viable solution, let's try 63 + (51 - 68), which equals 63 + (51 - 68) = 63 - 17 = 46.
So, the correct equation is 63 + (51 - 68) = 46.
</think>
<answer> 63 + (51 - 68) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 51, 63, and 68. We need to create an equation that equals 46 using each of these numbers exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
- Adding 51 and 63 gives us 114.
- Subtracting 68 from 114 gives us 46.
So the equation that uses 51, 63, and 68 to make 46 is 51 + 63 - 68 = 46.
</think>
<answer> 51 + 63 - 68 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 75, 26, 88, and 58. We need to create an equation that equals 79 using each number only once.
- If we try 88 - 75, we get 13, which isn't 79.
- Trying combinations with 58 and 26: 58 - 26 = 32, which is close but not 79.
- Let's try adding 26 to 58: 58 + 26 = 84, and then we need 4 more to make 79. So, 79 - 84 = -5 (which is not valid as we need a positive result).
- Now, let's see if we can use subtraction differently: 88 - 75 = 13. Now we need 79 - 13 = 66, so 66 - 26 = 40, and 40 - 13 = 27, but that's not 58 yet.
- Wait, what if we rearrange: 88 - 75 = 13, then use 58 + 13 = 71, and finally 79 - 71 = 8, which is not 58.
- Realizing the complexity, let's try another small difference: 88 - 58 = 30, then 75 - 30 = 45, and finally 45 + 26 does not give us 79.
- Trying: 75 + 26 = 101, not useful here. Let's see if we can directly use: 88 + 58 - 75 = 146 - 75 = 71 is not 79. 
- The only viable option having all combinations be checked: 88 + 26 - 75 - 58 is not right. 

After all those, the correct way I see now:
Considering: 88 - 26 = 62, then 62 + 75 - 58 = 79.
</think>
<answer> 88 - 26 + 75 - 58 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider all possible combinations using the basic arithmetic operations. We have the numbers 75, 26, 88, and 58. We need to find an equation that equals 79.
We can start with addition and subtraction to see if we can closely approximate 79:
- 75 + 26 = 101 (Too high)
- 75 + 88 = 163 (Too high)
- 75 + 58 = 133 (Too high)
- 75 + 26 - 88 = 13 (Too low)
- 75 + 26 - 58 = 43 (Too low)
- 88 + 26 = 114 (Too high)
- 88 + 58 = 146 (Too high)
- 88 + 26 - 75 = 40 (Too low)
- 58 + 26 = 84 (Too high)
- 58 + 26 - 75 = 9 (Too low)
Next, let's try multiplication and division:
- No straightforward simple multiplication or division will help as it would either be too large or not close enough.
Considering all basic operations and trying all combinations yields no solution exactly equal to 79. We may need to reconsider if there are other known identities or simplifications we're missing.
Revisiting and trying all combinations in a different order, we have:
58 + 26 - 75 = 9 + 26 - 75 = 35 - 75 = -40 (Too low, much too low)
However, let's reconsider differently:
75 + 88 - 26 - 58 = 163 - 84 = 79
Thus, we have found the correct equation.
</think>
<answer> 75 + 88 - 26 - 58 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 23, 4, and 73. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 46.
- Adding 23 and 4 gives us 27.
- Adding 73 and 23 gives us 96.
- Subtracting 23 from 73 gives us 50.
- Subtracting 4 from 23 gives us 19.
- Multiplying 23 and 4 gives us 92.
- Multiplying 23 and 73 gives us 1717, which is not 46.
- Multiplying 4 and 73 gives us 292, which is not 46.
- Adding and subtracting these numbers in different combinations hasn't given us 46 yet.
- Let's try the combination: 73 - 23 - 4 = 46.
This combination uses all three numbers exactly once and equals 46.
</think>
<answer> 73 - 23 - 4 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 19, 41, and 65. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 43.
- Adding or subtracting these numbers in different orders doesn't naturally get us close to 43.
- Considering multiplication and division, we see that 41 * 1 = 41 and 65 - 22 = 43 but 22 isn't available.
- 19 + 41 = 60 and 60 - 17 = 43 but 17 isn't available either.
- Now, looking at 65 - 41 = 24, and then 24 + 19 = 43, this fits our criteria.
So, the equation would be 65 - 41 + 19 which equals 43.
</think>
<answer> 65 - 41 + 19 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 22, 4, and 58. We need to create an equation that results in 76 using these numbers exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
- Adding 22 and 58 gives us 80.
- We need to subtract 4 to get to 76 from 80.
So the equation would be: 22 + 58 - 4 = 76.
</think>
<answer> 22 + 58 - 4 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 22, 4, and 58. We need to create an equation that equals 76 using each number exactly once and basic arithmetic operations.
- Let's try to add or subtract the numbers first to see if we can get closer to 76.
- 22 + 4 + 58 = 84 (which is too high)
- 22 + 4 - 58 = -32 (which is too low)
- Then, let's try multiplication and division.
- 22 * 4 = 88 (which is too high)
- 22 * 58 = 1276 (which is way too high)
- 58 * 4 = 232 (which is way too high)
- 58 / 4 = 14. 5 (not an integer, so not an option)
- 58 / 22 = 2. 636 (not an integer, so not an option)
- Now, let's try a combination of operations.
- 58 - 22 + 4 = 30 (which is too low)
- 58 - 4 + 22 = 86 (which is too high)
- By inspection, it seems a combination of addition and subtraction is needed.
- Finally, 58 + 22 - 4 = 76 (which is correct).
</think>
<answer> 58 + 22 - 4 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 33, 17, and 3. We need to use these numbers once each to make an equation equal to 13.
We can start by looking at the operations we can use: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
If we try 33 - 17, we get 16, which is too high.
If we try 33 - 3, we get 30, which is still too high.
If we try 33 - 17 + 3, we get 26, which is still high.
Let's try 33 - (17 + 3):
33 - (17 + 3) = 33 - 20 = 13.
This gives us our target result of 13.
</think>
<answer> 33 - (17 + 3) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 6, 8, and 36. We need to create an equation that equals 50 using these numbers exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by looking at the largest number, 36, because adding or multiplying it with another number could get us closer to 50.
- If we add 6 to 36, we get 42, which is close to 50.
- If we subtract 6 from 36, we get 30, which is also close but not what we need.
- Multiplying 6 and 8 gives us 48, which isn't 50.
- Dividing 36 by 6 gives us 6, which isn't 50 either.
Adding 6 to 36 gives us 42, and we need 8 to reach 50. So, 36 + 6 + 8 = 50. This works.
</think>
<answer> 36 + 6 + 8 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 26, 46, and 66. We need to create an equation that equals 86 using each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by trying different combinations:
- Adding: 26 + 46 + 66 = 138 (too high)
- Subtracting: 66 - 46 + 26 = 46 (too low)
- Multiplying and then adding/subtracting: Different orders of multiplication won't work since 26 * 46 = 1196 is far too high, and other combinations won't fit.
- Adding and then multiplying/subtracting: 26 + 46 = 72, then 72 - 66 = 6 (too low)
It seems we need a subtraction and addition in a different order:
Let's try 66 + 46 - 26 = 86. This combination fits as it uses all numbers exactly once and simplifies to our target.
</think>
<answer> 66 + 46 - 26 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 86, 17, and 15. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to equal 54.
- Adding the numbers: 86 + 17 + 15 = 118 (too high)
- Subtracting: The difference between 86 and 17 or 15 could be closer, but subtracting 15 from the sum of 86 and 17 or vice versa doesn't work.
- Multiplying and dividing: Multiplying any two of these numbers and then adding the third or dividing in some way doesn't seem to get us to 54.
- Let's try 86 - (17 + 15):
  1. 17 + 15 = 32
  2. 86 - 32 = 54
This gives us the correct result of 54 using each number exactly once.
</think>
<answer> 86 - (17 + 15) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 9, 49, and 52. We need to use each exactly once to make 12 using basic arithmetic operations.
- We know that 52 - 49 = 3, which isn't close to 12.
- Let's try combinations with 9: 9 + 49 = 58, 9 + 52 = 61, and 49 + 52 = 101, none of these equal 12.
- Now let's consider mixing operations: (52 - 49) + 9 = 3 + 9 = 12, which works.
So, the equation is (52 - 49) + 9 = 12.
</think>
<answer> (52 - 49) + 9 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 9, 49, and 52. We need to create an equation that equals 12 using each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
- 52 - 49 = 3, which is not 12.
- Adding 9 to other numbers doesn't easily give us 12.
- Considering multiplications and divisions:
  - 49 * 9 / 52 doesn't result in 12.
  - 52 / 9 + 49 gives approximately 61. 11, which is not 12.
  - 52 / (49 - 9) = 52 / 40 = 1. 3, which is not 12.
- Now, let's try rearranging: 9 + (49 / 52) gives a result not equal to 12.
- Finally, 49 - (52 / 9) looks promising. Let's check:
  - 52 / 9 ≈ 5. 78, then 49 - 5. 78 = 43. 22, which is not 12.
Given these calculations, it seems none of these simple combinations work with basic operations and numbers. However, there seems to be an oversight as the correct combination is actually:
- (49 - 52) + 9 = -3 + 9 = 6, which doesn't work.
- Another combination here is 52 - (49 / 9) which isn't straightforward either.
- Looking again with another trial: If we consider (52 - 49) + (9 - operation on isolated values), which is incorrect.
It seems I missed a different approach. However, the correct approach here is actually:
- This worked out: (52 - 49) + 9 - 49 + 52/9 - 52 = 12.
The possible solution path was overlooked. The correct different configuration was: (52 - 49) + (9 - operation can be isolation).
So, the correct operation finally would abstain conventions: 52 - 49 + 9
 </think>
<answer> 52 - 49 + 9 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 35, 16, 44, and 66. We need to create an equation that equals 91 using each number exactly once.
- Let's try to use multiplication and addition/subtraction: 
  - The number 66 is quite large, so using it directly could be tricky.
  - The sum of 35 and 44 is 79, which is close to 91.
  - If we subtract 44 from 66, we get 22, and if we add that to 79, we get 101, which is too high.
  - If we subtract 35 from 66, we get 31, and adding 44 to that gives 75, still not 91.
  - Finally, let's try: 66 - 35 + 16 + 44 = 91.
</think>
<answer> 66 - 35 + 16 + 44 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers and basic operations. We need to create an equation that equals 38 using the numbers 40, 71, 51, and 44 exactly once.
- We can start by trying to combine the largest numbers first since they will impact the result more.
- Let's try subtracting or adding smaller numbers to these larger ones.
- If we subtract a smaller number from a larger one, we can see if we can get close to 38.
- 71 - 40 = 31, which is close but not 38.
- Now, let's try adding smaller numbers to larger ones.
- 71 + 44 = 115, which is too large.
- Then try 40 + 71 = 111, which is also too large.
- Let's try a combination:
- 51 + 44 - 71 = 25 - 71 = -46, which is not 38.
- Let's try a different combination:
- 51 + 44 - 40 = 95 - 40 = 55, which is still not 38.
- Let's try 51 + (71 - 44) = 51 + 27 = 78, still too large.
- The only other combination left is:
- 40 + (71 - 51) = 40 + 20 = 60, still too large.
- The only remaining possibility:
- 71 + 44 - 51 - 40 = 115 - 91 = 24, still not 38.
- It seems we should try another combination:
- 51 + 44 - 71 + 40 = 95 - 71 + 40 = 24 + 40 = 64, still not 38.
- Finally, let's try:
- 71 - (51 - 44) = 71 - 7 = 64, still too large.
- Trying a different approach:
- 40 + (51 - 71 + 44) = 40 + 24 = 64, still too large.
- Trying another approach:
- (71 - 51) + 44 - 40 = 20 + 44 - 40 = 64 - 40 = 24, still not 38.
- Final tried combinations:
- 51 + (71 - 44 - 40) = 51 - 13 = 38.
</think>
<answer> 51 + (71 - 44 - 40) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 40, 71, 51, and 44. We need to use each number exactly once to get a result of 38.
- One approach could be to look for combinations that might simplify to 38 when combined.
- We can start with simple operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- If we subtract a smaller number from a larger one, we can get closer to 38.
- If we subtract 44 from 71, we get 27. Now we need 11 more to reach 38.
- The number 51 minus 40 gives us 11.
So, combining these, we get 71 - 44 + 51 - 40 = 38.
</think>
<answer> 71 - 44 + 51 - 40 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 68, 83, and 3. We need to create an equation that equals 18 using these numbers exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations.
One approach is to look for a combination that might give us the desired result. Let's try some combinations:
- 83 - 68 = 15 (not 18)
- 83 - 3 = 80 (not 18)
- 68 - 83 = -15 (not 18)
- 83 + 3 = 86 (not 18)
- 68 + 3 = 71 (not 18)
Now, let's try operations on different pairs:
- (83 - 68) + 3 = 15 + 3 = 18
This gives us the result we want. So, the equation is 83 - 68 + 3 = 18.
</think>
<answer> (83 - 68) + 3 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 68, 83, and 3. We need to create an equation that equals 18 using each number exactly once.
We can start by looking at the sum or difference of these numbers to see if we can get closer to 18.
- If we add 68 and 83, we get 151, which is far from 18.
- If we subtract 3 from 68, we get 65, and from 83, we get 80. Adding 65 and 80 gives us 145, still not 18.
- Now, let's try different combinations:
  - 83 - 68 = 15, and then 15 + 3 = 18.
  - This combination works as it uses all the numbers exactly once and equals 18.
So, the equation is 83 - 68 + 3 = 18.
</think>
<answer> 83 - 68 + 3 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 94, 52, 12, and 24. We need to use these numbers exactly once to get an equation that equals 54.
- We see that 94 + 52 = 146, which is far from 54.
- If we use subtraction, 94 - 52 = 42, which is closer but still not 54.
- Adding 12 and 24 gives us 36, which when added to 52 makes 88.
- Now let's try 94 - (12 + 24). This simplifies to 94 - 36 = 58.
- We see that 94 - 36 is too high, so let's try 52 + 12 - 24: This simplifies to 52 + 12 - 24 = 40.
- Finally, let's try 94 - 52 + 12 + 24. This simplifies to 42 + 36 = 78, which is not 54.
- Now, let's try 94 - 52 - 12 + 24: This simplifies to 42 - 12 + 24 = 30 + 24 = 54.
So, the correct equation is 94 - 52 - 12 + 24 = 54.
</think>
<answer> 94 - 52 - 12 + 24 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 73, 9, and 11. We need to create an equation that equals 71 using each of these numbers exactly once.
We can start by looking at the target number 71 and the numbers we have. The difference between 73 and 71 is 2, and the difference between 11 and 9 is 2. This suggests that subtracting 9 from 73 or adding 11 to 71 could be part of our solution.
Let's try subtracting 9 from 73:
73 - 9 = 64
Now we need to get from 64 to 71. We can do this by adding 11:
64 + 11 = 75
This is not correct as it exceeds 71. 
Let's instead try adding 11 to 71 and then subtract 9:
71 + 11 = 82
82 - 9 = 73
This is also incorrect as it exceeds 71.
Finally, let's try subtracting 9 from 73 and adding 11:
73 - 9 + 11 = 75
This is still not the correct solution.
Upon reviewing, we realize subtracting 9 from 73 and adding 11:
73 - 9 + 11 = 75 is incorrect, and no other combination seems to work. We missed that:
We can also check:
73 - 11 + 9 = 71
This gives us the right result. Thus, the correct equation is 73 - 11 + 9 = 71.
</think>
<answer> 73 - 11 + 9 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 37, 12, and 11. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once that equals 14.
Looking at the numbers, we can see that 37 - 23 should give us 14, but 23 is not in the list. However, we can use the sum of 12 and 11, which is 23.
So, if we use 37 - (12 + 11), we get:
37 - (12 + 11) = 37 - 23 = 14.
This satisfies the requirement of using all three numbers exactly once and results in 14.
</think>
<answer> 37 - (12 + 11) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 74, 85, and 55. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get 66.
- Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- If we add 74 and 55, we get 129, which is too high.
- If we subtract the smallest number from the sum of the other two, we get: 85 + 55 - 74 = 135 - 74 = 61, which is still too high.
- If we subtract the largest number from the sum of the other two, we get: 85 + 55 - 74 = 140 - 74 = 66.
This combination results in the desired number 66.
</think>
<answer> 85 + 55 - 74 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's examine the numbers we have: 47, 91, and 7. We need to create an equation that equals 51 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
- Adding or subtracting any two of these numbers doesn't get us close to 51.
- Multiplying 91 by 7 gives us 637, which is much too large.
- Multiplying 91 by 47 would be 4317, which is also too large.
- Let's try a combination of addition and subtraction:
  - 91 - 47 = 44
  - 44 - 7 = 37
  This still doesn't get us to 51.
- Now let's try another combination:
  - 91 + 7 = 98
  - 98 - 47 = 51
This combination works because it uses all three numbers exactly once and applies basic arithmetic operations to get the result of 51.
</think>
<answer> 91 + 7 - 47 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 47, 91, and 7. We need to create an equation from these that equals 51 using each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
- Start with the target number: 51
- We can try combinations of the numbers and operations:
  - 91 - 47 = 44 (not 51)
  - 91 - 7 = 84 (not 51)
  - 47 - 7 = 40 (not 51)
  - 91 - (47 - 7) = 51 (this works, using parentheses to group 47 - 7)
- 47 + 91 = 138 (not 51)
- 47 + 7 = 54 (not 51)
- 91 + 7 = 98 (not 51)
From the above, we see that (91 - (47 - 7)) equals 51, using each number exactly once.
</think>
<answer> 91 - (47 - 7) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 36, 86, and 93. We need to create an equation that equals 43 using each number exactly once and basic arithmetic operations.
One way to approach this is to try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Let's try: 93 - 86 + 36
93 - 86 = 7
7 + 36 = 43
This gives us our desired result of 43.
</think>
<answer> 93 - 86 + 36 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's evaluate the given numbers: 36, 86, and 93. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to equal 43.
- Adding and subtracting the smallest and largest numbers gives us: 93 - 36 = 57 (which is too large) or 86 - 36 = 50 (which is also too large).
- Subtracting the largest number from the sum of the other two: 86 + 36 - 93 = 122 - 93 = 29 (still too large).
- Adding the smallest number to the sum of the other two: 36 + 86 + 93 = 129 + 36 - 36 = 129 - 93 = 36 (still too large).
- Subtracting the smallest number from the sum of the two larger numbers: 86 + 93 - 36 = 179 - 36 = 143 (way too large).
- Adding the two larger numbers and subtracting the smallest: 86 + 93 - 36 = 179 - 36 = 143 (still too large).
- Finally, let's try a different combination: (93 - 86) + 36 = 7 + 36 = 43.
</think>
<answer> (93 - 86) + 36 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 83, 95, 98, and 5. We need to create an equation that equals 85 using each number exactly once and only basic arithmetic operations.
We can try different combinations:
83 + 95 - 98 = 80 (not 85)
95 - 83 - 98 = -86 (not 85)
98 - 95 - 83 = -80 (not 85)
Combining 83 and 95 could be promising:
83 + 95 = 178
Now we can see 178 - 98 = 80 (not 85), and adding 5 or 83 doesn't help.
We realize we missed a more straightforward combination:
98 - 95 + 83 = 86 (not 85)
Again, trying:
98 - 95 + 5 = 8 (not 85)
The right order was 83 + 95 - 98 + 5.
Let's check:
83 + 95 = 178
178 - 98 = 80
80 + 5 = 85
So the equation is 83 + 95 - 98 + 5 = 85.
</think>
<answer> 83 + 95 - 98 + 5 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 41, 79, and 73. We need to use these numbers exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 35.
Let's try different combinations:
- 41 - 79 + 73 would give us 41 - 79 + 73 = 35.
- Also, checking 79 - 41 + 73 = 35.
- And 73 - 41 + 79 = 101 which is not 35.
So, we have two potential equations: 41 - 79 + 73 and 79 - 41 + 73.
To make sure we're correct, let's verify:
41 - 79 + 73 = 35.
79 - 41 + 73 = 79 - 41 + 73 = 35.
Both are correct, but we'll stick to the first combination as it directly uses the numbers as provided.
</think>
<answer> 41 - 79 + 73 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list the operations we can use: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). We need to use the numbers 53, 40, and 15 exactly once each to get the result 28.
We can start by trying different combinations:
- 53 - 40 - 15 = -12 (too low)
- 53 - 40 + 15 = 28 (this looks promising)
- 53 + 40 - 15 = 80 (too high)
- 53 * 40 / 15 is not an integer, so doesn't work.
- 40 * 15 / 53 is not an integer and doesn't work either.
From these combinations, we can see that 53 - 40 + 15 equals 28. Therefore, the equation is correct.
</think>
<answer> 53 - 40 + 15 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 53, 40, and 15. We need to create an equation that equals 28 using each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
- Let's start by looking at the sum of the numbers: 53 + 40 + 15 = 108. This is close but not 28, so we need to subtract something.
- Now, let's try the combination 53 - 40 + 15. This gives us: 53 - 40 + 15 = 28.
This meets our criteria of using each number exactly once and creating an equation that equals 28.
</think>
<answer> 53 - 40 + 15 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 53, 40, and 15. We need to create an equation that equals 28 using each number exactly once and only basic arithmetic operations.
- Let's try different combinations, starting with the largest number, 53: 53 - 40 = 13, which is not 28.
- Next, we try 53 - 15 = 38, which is too high.
- Then, we try 40 - 15 = 25, which is not 28.
- Now, let's add numbers: 40 + 15 = 55, which is too high.
- 53 + 15 = 68, which is also too high.
- Let's try 53 - 40 + 15: 53 - 40 = 13, then 13 + 15 = 28.
This combination gives us the required result of 28 using all the numbers exactly once.
</think>
<answer> 53 - 40 + 15 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 6, 51, 89, and 37. We need to use these numbers exactly once to get the result of 97 using basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by looking at the target number (97) and the numbers we have. One way to approach this is to try to form combinations that might lead us to 97.
Considering the numbers, 89 is quite large, and 51 is close but still far from 97. Adding 37 to 51 gives us 88, which is close to 97 but still not there. Adding 6 to 88 is too much.
So, let's try subtracting instead. If we take 37 from 51, we get 14. Then adding 89 to 14 gives us 103, which is too much.
Now, let's try a different combination. We can consider subtracting the smaller numbers from a larger one. If we take 6 from 51, we get 45. Then adding 89 to 45 gives us 134, which is too large.
Now, let's try 6 from 89, which gives us 83. Adding 51 to 83 results in 134.
Finally, if we subtract 6 from 89, we get 83. Adding 51 gives us 134. This is still too large.
Considering all these attempts, let's simplify it. Notice that 51 + 37 = 88, and then adding 6 to 88 gives 94. Now, we need an extra 3 to reach 97. This suggests adding 6 to 88 and then subtracting 1 (or adding -1) isn't feasible direct.
But if we look at another simple idea, 89 - 37 = 52, and then adding 45 (since 51 + 4 = 55, but 55 - 8 = 45) gives 97. This configuration works with simpler arithmetic.
Therefore, an equation that works could be: 89 - 37 + 51 - 6 = 97.
</think>
<answer> 89 - 37 + 51 - 6 </answer>

<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 45, 96, and 21. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 72.
- Let's start by adding or subtracting these numbers to see if we can reach 72.
- Adding 45 and 21 gives us 66.
- Then, if we add 96 to 66, we get 162, which is too high.
- Now, let's try subtracting instead of adding.
- Subtracting 21 from 45 gives us 24.
- Then, subtracting this result from 96 gives us 96 - 24 = 72.
So, the equation is 96 - 45 + 21 = 72.
</think>
<answer> 96 - 45 + 21 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 45, 96, and 21. We need to create an equation that equals 72 using each number only once and with basic arithmetic operations.
One way to approach this is to try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
45 + 96 = 141
141 - 21 = 120
This doesn't work.
Let's try another combination:
96 - 45 = 51
51 + 21 = 72
This works, using each number exactly once.

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 67, 21, and 34. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once to get a result of 80.
We can start combining the numbers in different ways:
67 + 21 + 34 = 122 (This is too high)
67 + 34 - 21 = 80 (This is exactly what we need)
Here, we used 67, 34, and 21 to make the sum 80.

<think> First, we need to create an equation that uses the numbers 88, 42, and 7 exactly once to get the result of 53.
We can start by looking at the numbers and the target. One way to reach 53 using these numbers is to consider if any straightforward combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division can do it.
88 + 42 = 130
130 - 77 = 53 (but 77 is not available)
88 - 42 = 46
46 + 7 = 53
So we need 88 - 42 + 7 to equal 53.
</think>
<answer> (88 - 42) + 7 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 88, 42, and 7. We need to create an equation using these numbers only once that equals 53.
- Adding or subtracting these numbers in any combination doesn't seem to get us close to 53.
- Multiplying or dividing the numbers doesn't seem to work either as it results in either very large or very small numbers.
- Let's try combinations: 88 - 42 - 7 = 39 (too high)
- 88 - 42 + 7 = 53 (This looks promising)
- Checking this, 88 - 42 + 7 indeed equals 53.
</think>
<answer> 88 - 42 + 7 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 88, 42, and 7. We need to create an equation that equals 53 using each number exactly once and basic arithmetic operations.
- Let's start by trying to use the subtraction operation since we often need to reduce numbers to reach our target.
- We can try 88 - 42 - 7. Let's calculate:
  88 - 42 = 46
  46 - 7 = 39
This doesn't give us 53. We need to get closer.
- Let's try another combination. What if we use 88 - (42 + 7)?
  42 + 7 = 49
  88 - 49 = 39
  Still not 53.
- Now let's try 88 - 42 + 7:
  88 - 42 = 46
  46 + 7 = 53
This combination works because 88 - 42 + 7 equals 53.

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 16, 70, and 69. We need to create an equation that equals 17 using each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by looking at possible combinations:
- Adding and subtracting: 16 + 70 - 69 = 26 - 69 = -43 (not 17)
- Multiplying and dividing: 16 * 70 / 69 = 1120 / 69 ≈ 16.27 (not 17)
- Trying another combination: 70 - 16 - 69 = -55 (not 17)
Let's try another operation combination:
- 70 - 69 + 16 = 17 (this works)
So, the equation that uses all numbers exactly once and equals 17 is 70 - 69 + 16.
</think>
<answer> 70 - 69 + 16 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 46, 12, and 18. We need to create an equation that equals 76 using these numbers exactly once.
We can try different combinations of operations:
- 46 + 12 + 18 = 76 (This works! Each number is used exactly once and the equation equals 76.)
- Let's verify this solution: 46 + 12 = 58, then 58 + 18 = 76, which is correct.
Therefore, the equation that uses 46, 12, and 18 to make 76 is 46 + 12 + 18.

<answer> 46 + 12 + 18 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 96, 22, and 51. We need to create an equation that equals 67 using each number exactly once and basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by trying to combine the numbers in different ways:
96 - 22 = 74 (which is too high)
96 - 51 = 45 (which is too low)
22 + 51 = 73 (which is close, but we need a lower number to reach 67)
Now let's try:
96 - 51 - 22: This equals 23, which is too low.
96 - 51 + 22: This equals 67, which is exactly what we need.
So, the equation that works is 96 - 51 + 22 = 67.

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 56, 45, and 74. We need to use each number exactly once and combine them using basic arithmetic operations to get 63.
One way to approach this is to check different combinations:
56 - 45 = 11
11 + 74 = 85 (This doesn't work as it's too high)
Let's try another combination:
74 - 45 = 29
29 + 56 = 85 (Still too high)
Now let's try:
56 + 45 = 101 (This is too high too)
We might have overlooked some simpler combination:
74 + 45 - 56 = 63
Let's check:
74 + 45 = 119
119 - 56 = 63 (This works)
So, the equation is 74 + 45 - 56 = 63.

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 56, 45, and 74. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 63.
We can start by looking at the numbers and considering different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
56 + 45 = 101 (which is too high)
56 + 74 = 130 (which is also too high)
45 + 74 = 119 (again, too high)
56 - 45 = 11 (too low)
74 - 56 = 18 (too low)
Now, let's try multiplication and division:
56 * 45 = 2520 (way too high)
45 * 74 = 3330 (even higher than before)
74 * 45 = 3330 (still too high)
56 / 45 = 1. 244... (not an integer, so not useful)
45 / 74 = 0. 610... (not an integer, so not useful)
74 / 56 = 1. 321... (not an integer, so not useful)
Finally, let's try:
56 - (45 / 74) = 56 - 0. 600 (approximately) = 55. 4 (still not 63)
After exhausting these possibilities, we notice we haven't fully used each number once. Let's try:
56 - 45 + 74 = 85 (too high)
And try another combination:
74 - 45 + 56 = 79 (too high)
This seems like we are missing a calculation. Let's try this:
45 + 74 - 56 = 63 (this equals our target)
So, the final equation is 45 + 74 - 56 = 63.
</think>
<answer> 45 + 74 - 56 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list the numbers available: 3, 54, 3, 1. We need to form an equation that uses these numbers exactly once to equal 64.
We can start by trying different combinations of operations. Let's see:
- Using multiplication and addition: 54 * 3 + 1 = 162 + 1 = 163 (too high)
- Using addition and subtraction: 54 + 3 + 1 - 3 = 55 (too low)
- Using multiplication and addition: 54 + (3 * 1) = 54 + 3 = 57 (too low)
- Using subtraction: 54 - 3 - 3 + 1 = 51 - 3 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 (too low)
- Using exponentiation: 54^1 + 3 - 3 = 54 + 3 - 3 = 54 (too low)
- Trying another combination: 54 + 3 * (1 - 3) = 54 + 3 * (-2) = 54 - 6 = 48 (too low)
Finally, trying this one: 54 + 3 * 3 + 1 = 54 + 9 + 1 = 64
Now we have formed the equation that uses all the numbers exactly once and equals 64.
</think>
<answer> 54 + 3 * 3 + 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 3, 54, 3, and 1. We need to use each number exactly once to get the result of 64.
We can try different combinations:
- 54 - 3 - 3 = 51 (This is close but not 64)
- 54 - 3 + 3 = 54 (This is not 64)
- 54 + 1 = 55 (This is not 64)
- Let's try rearranging: 54 + 3 - 3 + 1 = 55 (This is not 64 as well)
- Now let's try 54 - 3 - 1: 54 - 3 - 1 = 50 (Not 64)
- Another combination: 54 - 3 + 1 = 52 (This is not 64)
It seems none of the simple combinations are working. However, we can try using multiplication and addition:
- 54 * 3 + 1 = 162 + 1 = 163 (This is too large)
- 54 * 3 + 3 = 162 + 3 = 165 (This is also too large)
- Let's try 54 * 1 + 3 = 54 + 3 = 57 (This is not 64)
After exhausting these combinations, we can see that we may have missed a simple one that we can't see by logic:
- 54 - (3 * 3) + 1 = 54 - 9 + 1 = 45 + 1 = 46 (This is not 64)
Finally, we can test if any different grouping might work:
- (54 - 3) + 3 + 1 = 51 + 3 + 1 = 55
Now, it seems we have not found the right operation distribution. 
The quickest we can validate is checking the correct operation: 54 + (3 * 3) + 1 = 54 + 9 + 1 = 64
This works, as it gives us exactly 64.
</think>
<answer> 54 + (3 * 3) + 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to create an equation that uses the numbers 20, 76, and 20 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations. We can start by considering the position of each number. The number 76 is a bit unusual as one of the numbers, suggesting it might be the result of an operation on the other two numbers.
- Let's try to add 20 and 20: 20 + 20 = 40, which is not 76.
- Next, let's try to multiply 20 and 20: 20 * 20 = 400, which is too large.
- Now, let's multiply and add: 20 * 20 + 76 = 400 + 76 = 476, which is also too large.
- Let's try a different combination: 76 - (20 - 20) = 76 - 0 = 76.
This combination works because 20 - 20 equals 0, so subtracting 0 from 76 leaves 76 as the result.
</think>
<answer> 76 - (20 - 20) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 55, 24, and 65 that equals 96. Let's try different combinations:
1. 55 + 24 + 65 = 144 (This is too high)
2. 65 + 24 + 55 = 144 (This is still too high)
3. 65 + 55 - 24 = 96 (This seems like a good fit)
4. 55 + 65 - 24 = 96 (This also equals 96)
So, we have two potential equations: 65 + 55 - 24 and 55 + 65 - 24. Both are correct.
</think>
<answer> 65 + 55 - 24 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 46, 92, 15, and 26. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get 97.
- Adding 46 and 92 gives us 138.
- Subtracting 26 from 138 gives us 112.
- Subtracting 15 from 112 gives us 97.
So, the equation is 46 + 92 - 26 - 15 = 97.
</think>
<answer> 46 + 92 - 26 - 15 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 71, 78, and 87. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get 94.
- One way to approach this is to see if any combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division can give us 94.
- Adding or subtracting these numbers did not work out directly.
- Considering multiplication or division, 87 * 1 = 87 and 78 * 1 = 78, which are close but not 94.
- Then, we see that 87 - 78 = 9, and if we use 71 and adding this 9, we get 71 + 9 = 80, which is not 94.
- We need 94, so let's try a different combination. If we use 87 - 71 = 16, and then add 78, we get 16 + 78 = 94, which is the target number.
- Therefore, the equation is 87 - 71 + 78 = 94.
</think>
<answer> 87 - 71 + 78 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers given: 71, 78, and 87. We need to form an equation that equals 94 using each number only once with basic arithmetic operations.
We can try different combinations:
- 87 - 71 = 16
- 16 + 78 = 94
This combination works. Therefore, the equation is 87 - 71 + 78 = 94.
</think>
<answer> 87 - 71 + 78 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 69, 31, and 26. We need to use each of these numbers exactly once to get a result of 74 using basic arithmetic operations.
- Adding 69 and 31 gives us 100.
- Subtracting 26 from 100 gives us 74.
So the equation would be: 69 + 31 - 26 = 74.
</think>
<answer> 69 + 31 - 26 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 74, 67, 97, and 43. We need to create an equation that equals 87 using each number exactly once.
- Adding 74 and 67 gives us 141.
- Subtracting 43 from 141 gives us 98.
- Subtracting 97 from 98 gives us 1.
None of these directly lead us to 87.
- If we multiply 74 by 67, we get 4958, which is far too large.
- We should try combinations of operations.
- Let's try adding 74 and 14 (which is 67 + 43), then subtracting 97: (74 + (67 + 43)) - 97 = 74 + 110 - 97 = 87.
This uses each number exactly once and results in 87.
</think>
<answer> (74 + (67 + 43)) - 97 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 87, 10, and 25. We need to create an equation that equals 52 using each of these numbers exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations.
- We can start by looking at the numbers and seeing which operations might help us reach 52.
- If we add 25 and 10, we get 35. We need 17 more to reach 52.
- The number 87 is quite large and can't easily be adjusted by the other two numbers with just +, -, *, or / to give us 17.
- However, if we take 87 and subtract (25 + 10), we get: 87 - 35 = 52.
- This satisfies the requirement of using each number exactly once and applying basic arithmetic operations.
Therefore, the equation is 87 - (10 + 25) = 52.
</think>
<answer> 87 - (10 + 25) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's examine the numbers we have: 87, 10, and 25. We need to create an equation using these numbers only once each that equals 52.
We can start by trying different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Let's try:
(87 - 25) + 10 = 62 + 10 = 72
This isn't 52.
Next, let's try:
87 - (25 + 10) = 87 - 35 = 52
This is exactly what we needed.
So the equation is: 87 - (25 + 10) = 52.
</think>
<answer> 87 - (25 + 10) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 13, 7, and 37. We need to create an equation that equals 43 using each number exactly once and only basic arithmetic operations.
- One approach is to see if we can add or subtract to reach our goal.
- Adding 37 and 7 gives us 44, which is close to 43 but a bit too high.
- Subtracting 13 from 37 gives us 24, and then adding 7 results in 31, which is too low.
- Now, let's try another combination: subtracting 7 from 37 and then adding 13. This would be 37 - 7 + 13.
- Calculating 37 - 7 gives 30, and then adding 13 gives 43.
This combination works.
</think>
<answer> 37 - 7 + 13 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to use the numbers 37, 24, and 60 exactly once to get 47 as the result. Let's try combining the numbers using addition and subtraction first.
- We see that 60 - 37 = 23. This gives us a number closer to 47.
- Now we need an additional 24 to reach 47. We have 24 available, so we can use it.
- Thus, 23 + 24 = 47.
So, the equation is 60 - 37 + 24 which equals 47.
</think>
<answer> 60 - 37 + 24 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers 92, 55, and 47. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once, which equals 84. 
- One way to approach this is to try combining these numbers using different operations.
- Let's start by adding 92 and 47: 92 + 47 = 139.
- This is a bit too large, so let's try subtraction. Let's subtract 47 from 92: 92 - 47 = 45.
- Now we have 45 and 55 left. Adding 55 to 45: 45 + 55 = 100.
- This is still too large. Let's try another combination: subtracting 55 from 92: 92 - 55 = 37.
- Now we have 47 and 37. Adding 37 and 47: 37 + 47 = 84.
- This gives us the desired result of 84. So the equation is 92 - 55 + 47 = 84.
</think>
<answer> 92 - 55 + 47 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's identify the numbers we have: 92, 55, and 47. We need to form an equation that equals 84 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
- We can try different combinations, but let's start with simple operations.
- If we subtract 47 from 92, we get 45. Then, we need 39 more to reach 84.
- Now, we see that 55 - 47 = 8, which doesn't help immediately.
- Instead, let's try 92 - 55 = 37. Now we need 47 more to reach 84.
- Finally, 84 - 37 = 47. This works.
So, the equation is: 92 - 55 + 47 = 84.
</think>
<answer> 92 - 55 + 47 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 5, 7, and 17. We need to combine these using basic arithmetic operations to get 29.
We can start by looking at the sum of the first two numbers: 5 + 7 = 12.
Next, we need an additional number that when added to 12, gives us 29. So we calculate 12 + 17 = 29.
Thus, the equation is simply: 5 + 7 + 17 = 29.
</think>
<answer> 5 + 7 + 17 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 5, 7, and 17. We need to combine these using basic arithmetic operations to get the result of 29.
- Adding the smallest number (5) to the largest number (17) gives us 22. This is close but not quite 29.
- Adding the middle number (7) to this sum (22) gives us 29. So we have 5 + 17 + 7 = 29.
Thus, the equation is 5 + 17 + 7 = 29.
</think>
<answer> 5 + 17 + 7 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 1, 61, and 10. We need to use these exactly once to make 70.
We can start by looking at the possible combinations:
- 61 + 10 = 71 (which is close but not 70)
- 61 - 10 = 51 (which is far from 70)
- 61 * 1 = 61 (which is not 70)
- 10 * 1 = 10 (which is not 70)
- 10 + 1 = 11 (which is not 70)
- 1 + 61 = 62 (which is not 70)
From this, it's clear the direct arithmetic operations don't give us 70. Now let's try adding or subtracting the numbers in a different order:
- 61 + 10 + 1 = 72 (which is too high)
- 61 + 1 + 10 = 72 (which is too high)
- 1 + 61 + 10 = 72 (which is too high)
None of these show an immediate way to reach 70. However, maybe we can creatively group the numbers:
- (61 - 1) + 10 = 60 + 10 = 70
This combination works as 61 minus 1 gives 60, and then adding 10 equals 70.
</think>
<answer> (61 - 1) + 10 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 13, 74, and 67. We need to create an equation that equals 20 using each number exactly once.
We can start by looking at simple combinations of these numbers and operations:
1. 74 - 67 = 7 (not 20)
2. 74 - 13 = 61 (not 20)
3. 67 - 13 = 54 (not 20)
4. 74 + 13 = 87 (not 20)
5. 67 + 13 = 80 (not 20)
It seems basic combinations are not working. Let's try some other operations:
6. 74 + 13 - 67 = 20
This appears to be a viable combination.
So, the equation is 74 + 13 - 67 = 20.
</think>
<answer> 74 + 13 - 67 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers provided: 24, 42, and 67. We need to create an equation that equals 85 using these numbers exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations.
One approach is to try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Let's try: 67 - 24 + 42
67 - 24 = 43
43 + 42 = 85
This gives us the result we need, 85.
</think>
<answer> 67 - 24 + 42 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 65, 6, and 6. We need to create an equation that equals 77 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
- We see that 65 is quite close to 77, so we might start by considering how we can use the other numbers to get to this value.
- Adding 6 and 6 gives us 12.
- If we add 65 and 12, we get 77.
So, the equation would be 65 + 6 + 6 = 77.
</think>
<answer> 65 + 6 + 6 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 51, 65, and 4. We need to use each number exactly once to get a result of 10 using basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by looking at the operations we have: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
Let's try some combinations:
51 + 65 = 116 (not equal to 10)
65 - 51 = 14 (not equal to 10)
51 * 65 = 3315 (not equal to 10)
65 / 51 ≈ 1.26 (not equal to 10)
Now, let's try a combination that includes division and subtraction:
65 - 51 - 4 = 10 (This equals 10 exactly)
So, the equation using the numbers 51, 65, and 4 to get 10 is 65 - 51 - 4 = 10.
</think>
<answer> 65 - 51 - 4 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 61, 14, and 94. We need to create an equation that equals 19 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by looking at the numbers and considering what operations might work:
- Adding or subtracting these numbers in various combinations doesn't seem to get us close to 19.
- Multiplying these numbers doesn't seem to lead to 19 either.
- The division might be the key, but we need to ensure we're using each number exactly once.
Let's try:
94 - 61 = 33
Then we need something that, when subtracted from or added to 33, equals 19.
33 - 14 = 19
So this seems to work.
Therefore, the equation is 94 - 61 - 14 = 19.
</think>
<answer> 94 - 61 - 14 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 24, 87, and 18. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once to result in 93.
Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
- 87 + 24 + 18 = 129 (This is too high)
- 87 + 24 - 18 = 93 (This seems promising)
- 87 + 18 - 24 = 81 (This is too low)
- 87 - 24 + 18 = 81 (This is too low)
- 24 + 87 - 18 = 93 (This is correct)
- 24 - 18 + 87 = 93 (This is correct)
From the above calculations, we can see that both 87 + 24 - 18 and 24 + 87 - 18 equal 93. However, the problem states to show the work and we'll choose one of the valid solutions.
</think>
<answer> 87 + 24 - 18 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 81, 33, and 22. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations, that equals 70.
- Adding 81 and 22 gives us 103.
- Subtracting 33 from 103 gives us 70.
So, the equation would be 81 + 22 - 33 = 70.
- Let's verify: 81 + 22 equals 103, and then subtracting 33 from 103 gives us 70.
This satisfies the requirement of the problem.
</think>
<answer> 81 + 22 - 33 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 58, 90, and 64. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once that equals 84.
We can try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
- 90 + 64 - 58 = 96 - 58 = 38 (not 84)
- 90 + 58 - 64 = 148 - 64 = 84 (this works)
So, the equation 90 + 58 - 64 equals 84. 
</think>
<answer> 90 + 58 - 64 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 58, 90, and 64. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 84.
- Let's try combining 90 and 64 first: 90 + 64 = 154, which is not 84.
- Next, let's try 90 - 64 = 26. Now we need 58 to get to 84. Adding 58 to 26 gives us 84: 90 - 64 + 58 = 84.
This meets the requirements of using each number exactly once and results in 84.
</think>
<answer> 90 - 64 + 58 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 13, 2, and 1. We need to use each number exactly once to get an equation that equals 16.
- One way to approach this is to try different combinations of operations. Let's start with a combination that might be helpful: using 13 as the starting point, we can try to adjust it using the other two numbers.
- We see that 13 + 2 = 15, which is close to 16. If we add the last number, 1, it will get even closer: 15 + 1 = 16.
- Therefore, the equation that satisfies the condition is 13 + 2 + 1.
</think>
<answer> 13 + 2 + 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 27, 1, and 69. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations, that equals 43.
- Adding or subtracting these numbers won't get us close to 43.
- Multiplying 69 by 1 gives us 69, which is too high.
- Multiplying 27 by 1 gives us 27, which is too low.
- If we subtract 27 from 69, we get 42. This is very close to 43.
- Adding 1 to 42 gives us exactly 43.
So the equation that uses the numbers 27, 1, and 69 exactly once, that results in 43, is 69 - 27 + 1.
</think>
<answer> 69 - 27 + 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 30, 57, and 69. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations, that equals 18.
One way to approach this is to think about combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division that could work.
- Trying addition: 30 + 57 + 69 = 156 (not 18)
- Trying subtraction: 69 - 57 - 30 = -18 (works, but we need a positive 18)
- Trying multiplication and division: 
  - 69 * 30 / 57 = 2070 / 57 = 36.76 (not 18)
  - 30 * 57 / 69 = 1710 / 69 = 24.69 (not 18)
  - 69 * 57 / 30 = 3933 / 30 = 131.1 (not 18)
- We see that trying combinations of operations does not directly get us to 18. Let's consider rearranging the numbers:
  - 57 - 30 + 69 = 96 (too high)
  - 30 - 57 + 69 = 42 (too high)
  - 69 - 57 + 30 = 42 (too high)
  - 69 + 30 - 57 = 42 (too high)
  - 57 + 30 - 69 = 18 (this works)
Therefore, we have found the correct combination. The equation is 57 + 30 - 69 = 18.
</think>
<answer> 57 + 30 - 69 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 89, 32, 80, and 71. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to equal 30.
We can try different combinations of the operations and numbers:
89 - 32 - 80 = -23
89 - 32 + 80 = 137
89 + 32 - 80 = 41
89 + 32 + 80 = 201
89 - 80 + 32 = 31
80 - 71 + 32 = 41
71 - 80 + 32 = 23
71 + 32 - 80 = 23
71 + 32 + 80 = 183
It seems that none of these combinations work. Let's try another combination:
(89 - 80) + 32 = 9 + 32 = 41
This still doesn't give us 30. Let's try different orders and operations:
32 + 80 - 89 = 3
This is still not right. Let's try:
80 + 71 - 89 = 42 - 89 = -47
We are still far from 30. Let's try:
89 + 32 - 80 - 71 = 121 - 151 = -30
This gives us -30 but we need 30. Let's reverse the signs:
(89 - 80) - 32 + 71 = 9 - 32 + 71 = -23 + 71 = 48
It seems like no simple combination is working. Let's do this differently:
(89 - 80) + (32 - 71) = 9 + (-39) = -30
That was close, but not correct. Finally, let me try:
80 - (89 + 32 - 71) = 80 - 20 = 60
Still not correct. Let me try:
89 - (80 - 32) - 71 = 89 - 48 - 71 = -30
Again, not correct. Let me try:
89 - 80 - (32 - 71) = 9 - 39 + 71 = 41
We are getting away from 30. Let me retake a different check. Here it is:
80 + (32 - 71) = 80 - 39 = 41
Still not correct. Let me try again:
(89 - 80) + (32 - 71) - 32 = 9 - 39 - 32 = -62
This is still not correct. Finally, what if let me test:
(80 + 32 - 71) - 89 = 41 - 89 = -48
This gives very close to negative. From reverse candidates:
(89 + 32 - 80) - 71 = 41 - 71 = -30
This gives less than needed. Let me check differently: 
80 - (89 - 32) - 71 = 80 - 57 - 71 = -48
Not working. Reviewing combinations, trying:
89 - (32 + 71) - 80 = 89 - 103 - 80 = -94
This need more calculation work. Let me confirm:
89 - (80 + (32 - 71)) = 89 - 103 = -14
Hence, reverse combo confirm closest:
(89 - 80) + (71 - 32) - 80 = 9 + 39 - 80 = 48
Thus, the correct check: 
32 + 80 - 89 = 3
It still needs to revalidate.

<answer> 80 - 32 + 71 - 89 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 55, 8, 58, and 94. We need to create an equation that equals 89 using each number exactly once.
- We can start by looking at the numbers to see if there's a combination that works. 
- We notice that 94 - 55 = 39, which is close to 89 but not quite there.
- Then, we see 94 - 55 = 39 and 58 - 8 = 50, which gives us 39 + 50 = 89.
- So, the equation combining these operations and using all the numbers exactly once is (94 - 55) + (58 - 8) = 89.
</think>
<answer> (94 - 55) + (58 - 8) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 85, 42, and 14. We need to create an equation that equals 57 using these numbers exactly once.
We can start by looking at the operations we can use: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Trying to add or subtract the numbers directly to get 57 doesn't seem to work easily:
  - 85 + 42 + 14 = 141
  - 85 + 42 - 14 = 113
  - 85 + 14 - 42 = 57 (this combination works)
  - 42 + 14 - 85 = -31
  - 85 - 42 + 14 = 57
  - 42 - 14 + 85 = 113
From this, we see that 85 + 14 - 42 equals 57.
</think>
<answer> 85 + 14 - 42 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 2, 20, and 74. We need to use each number exactly once to get a result of 92.
We can start by looking at the numbers closely:
- 74 is close to 72 (which is 2 * 36), so let's see if we can use 20 and 2 in a way that relates to 74.
- We know 20 + 2 = 22, but this doesn't seem to help us reach 92.
- Another combination is 20 - 2 = 18, which also doesn't lead us to the answer.
- Now let's try subtracting 20 from 74: 74 - 20 = 54.
- To get from 54 to 92, we need an additional 38.
- Since we only have one number left, 2, it doesn't help us reach 38.
Given this, let's try a different approach:
- 74 - 2 = 72
- 72 + 20 = 92
This combination uses all three numbers exactly once and results in 92.
</think>
<answer> 74 - 2 + 20 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 53, 44, and 73. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to equal 82.
One useful strategy is to try combining the numbers using different operations.
Let's see if we can make 82 by adding or subtracting these numbers in some combination.
- If we add 53 and 44, we get 97, which is too high.
- If we add 53 and 73, we get 126, which is also too high.
- If we subtract 53 from 73, we get 20, which doesn't help.
- If we subtract 73 from 53, we get -20, which doesn't help either.
Now, let's try multiplying and subtracting:
- If we multiply 53 and 44, we get 2332, which is much too high.
- If we multiply 73 and 44, we get 3212, which is also too high.
It seems combining them through multiplication or higher operations isn't useful here.
Considering subtraction:
- If we subtract 44 from 53, we get 9, which is still too low.
Let's try a combination:
- If we add 73 and 44 and then subtract 53, we get (73 + 44) - 53 = 117 - 53 = 64, which isn't right.
- If we subtract 53 from 73 and then add 44, we get (73 - 53) + 44 = 20 + 44 = 64, which isn't right.
No obvious combination seems to work with direct addition or subtraction. Let's instead try a mixed combination.
If we calculate (53 * 1. 5) - 44 + 73, we don't have integer calculation, and it seems to be missing a better fit.
Let's try adding 53 and 44 to 73:
53 + 44 + 73 = 170, not 82.
Finally, let's try 73 - 53 + 44:
73 - 53 + 44 = 20 + 44 = 64, still not 82.
Out of the combinations:
Since 73 + 44 - 53 = 64, obviously we need a different approach.
Trying 53 + 73 - 44 = 82 gets us very close to the target.
So the correct combination equals:
(53 + 73) - 44 = 82
</think>
<answer> (53 + 73) - 44 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers available: 70, 2, and 4. We need to create an equation that equals 78 using each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
- Let's try combining 70 and 8 to get 78, but we only have 2 and 4 left.
- Now, 4 * 2 = 8, which is what we need to add to 70 to get 78.
So the equation would be: 70 + (4 * 2) = 78.
</think>
<answer> 70 + (4 * 2) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 47, 61, and 73. We need to create an equation using these numbers only once, with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to get the result 87.
- Adding the three numbers: 47 + 61 + 73 = 181 (which is not 87)
- Subtracting the numbers: There are too many combinations and none of them give 87
- Multiplying and dividing: After checking, (73 * 61) / 47 = 10273 / 47 = 218. 56 (which is not 87)
Since the above straightforward operations did not yield 87, let's consider different combinations:
(73 + 61) - 47 = 134 - 47 = 87
This combination provides the correct result of 87.
</think>
<answer>(73 + 61) - 47</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers 79, 42, and 59. We need to create an equation that equals 62 using each of these numbers exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by looking at combinations of operations:
- Subtracting 59 from 79 gives us 20 (79 - 59 = 20).
- Now we need another number to add to this 20 to get 62 (20 + ? = 62).
- The only number left is 42, but adding 42 to 20 does not give us 62 (20 + 42 = 62, which is correct!).
Therefore, the equation that uses all numbers exactly once and equals 62 is 79 - 59 + 42 = 62.
</think>
<answer> 79 - 59 + 42 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 34, 43, and 42. We need to create an equation using these numbers only once and the basic arithmetic operations to get the result 33.
- Let's try different combinations:
  - 43 - 34 = 9 (not 33)
  - 43 - 42 = 1 (not 33)
  - 44 - 34 = 10 (not 33)
  - 44 - 42 = 2 (not 33)
  - 42 - 34 = 8 (not 33)
  - 42 + 34 = 76 (not 33)
  - 43 + 34 = 77 (not 33)
  - Let's try 43 - 34 + 42:
    - 43 - 34 = 9
    - 9 + 42 = 51 (not 33)
  - Let's try 34 - 43 + 42:
    - 34 - 43 = -9
    - -9 + 42 = 33 (this works)
So we have found that 34 - 43 + 42 = 33.
</think>
<answer> 34 - 43 + 42 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to create an equation that uses the numbers 90, 20, and 95 exactly once to equal 25. 
We can start by looking at the operations we can use: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
If we try multiplication and division first, we quickly see that neither can get us to 25 with these numbers. 
Next, let's try combinations of addition and subtraction.
- 90 - 20 - 95 = -95 (not 25)
- 90 - 20 + 95 = 165 (not 25)
- 90 + 20 - 95 = 15 (not 25)
- 90 + 20 + 95 = 205 (not 25)
We can also try different orders of operations:
- 95 - 90 + 20 = 25 (This equals 25)
So, the equation that works is 95 - 90 + 20 = 25.
</think>
<answer> 95 - 90 + 20 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 68, 13, and 23. We need to create an equation that equals 78 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
One approach is to check if any combination of the numbers, when combined through multiplication or addition, gives us 78.
68 + 13 + 23 = 104 (This is too high)
Let's try 68 - 13 + 23 = 78. If we do this, we use all the numbers exactly once.
68 - 13 + 23 = 75 + 3 = 78.
So, we have the equation 68 - 13 + 23 = 78.
</think>
<answer> 68 - 13 + 23 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's examine the numbers we have: 68, 13, and 23. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations, to get 78.
We can start by checking if any straightforward combination of these numbers might work:
- Adding them: 68 + 13 + 23 = 104 (too high)
- Subtracting: 68 - 13 - 23 = 32 (too low)
- Multiplying and adding/subtracting: 68 * 13 - 23 = 884 - 23 = 861 (way too high)
- Exploring different orders: 68 + 23 - 13 = 78 (this works! )
So, the numbers 68, 23, and 13 can be rearranged to form the correct equation: 68 + 23 - 13 = 78.
</think>
<answer> 68 + 23 - 13 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's examine the numbers we have: 69, 36, and 18. We need to combine these numbers using basic arithmetic operations to get 71.
We can start by trying different combinations:
- Adding the three numbers: 69 + 36 + 18 = 123 (too high)
- Subtraction attempts: 
  - 69 - 36 - 18 = 15 (too low)
  - 69 - 36 + 18 = 41 (too low)
  - 69 + 36 - 18 = 87 (too high)
- Multiplication and division attempts:
  - 69 * 36 / 18 = 138 (too high)
  - 69 / 36 * 18 = 35.25 (not an integer)
  - 36 * 18 / 69 = 9.74 (not an integer)
Since direct combinations with these numbers don't yield 71, we need to reconsider the order and operations. We notice that 69 and 36 are close to 71, so let's try:
(72 - 18) / 69 - 36 = 72 / 69 - 36 = 1.0436 - 36 = -34.9564 (too low)
Trying another order or adjusting the operations didn't yield 71. Let's try:
(69 + 36) - 18 = 105 - 18 = 87 (too high)
Trying the operations again on the same numbers:
69 + 36 / 18 = 69 + 2 = 71 (this works)
</think>
<answer> 69 + 36 / 18 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 42, 99, and 17. We need to form an equation using these three numbers exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations, that equals 40.
Let's try different combinations:
- 99 - 42 - 17 = 30 (not 40)
- 99 - 42 + 17 = 74 (not 40)
- 99 + 42 - 17 = 124 (not 40)
- 99 + 42 + 17 = 158 (not 40)
- 42 + 99 - 17 = 124 (not 40)
- 42 - 99 + 17 = -20 (not 40)
It seems the combinations are not working out. Let's try another way:
- 99 + (42 - 17) = 99 + 25 = 124 (not 40)
Then, another one:
- 99 - (42 - 17) = 99 - 25 = 74 (not 40)
It looks like we need to incorporate the numbers in a different way. Let's try:
- (99 - 42) + 17 = 57 + 17 = 74 (not 40)
But if we do:
- (99 - 42) + (17 - 17) = 57+0 = 57 (not 40).
Here is a different approach:
- (99 - 17) + 42 = 82 + 42 = 124 (not 40)
Finally, a valid combination found:
- (99 - 17) - 42 = 82 - 42 = 40
</think>
<answer> (99 - 17) - 42 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 47, 23, and 31. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 55.
Let's try combining them through basic arithmetic operations:
- Adding and subtracting: 47 + 23 - 31 = 39 (not 55)
- Subtracting and adding in different orders: 47 - 23 + 31 = 55 (this equals 55)
So, the equation 47 - 23 + 31 satisfies the condition.
</think>
<answer> 47 - 23 + 31 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 47, 23, and 31. We need to create an equation that equals 55 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try different combinations:
- 47 - 23 + 31 = 55 (This combination works because 47 - 23 equals 24, and 24 + 31 equals 55)
- Other combinations like 47 + 23 - 31, 47 + (23 + 31), 23 + 31 - 47, etc. do not result in 55.
Thus, the correct equation is 47 - 23 + 31 = 55.
</think>
<answer> 47 - 23 + 31 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 98, 91, and 89. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 96.
We can start by adding or subtracting the numbers:
98 + 91 = 189
98 + 89 = 187
91 + 89 = 180
98 - 91 = 7
98 - 89 = 9
91 - 89 = 2
None of these simple combinations work. Let's try a different approach by combining them using multiplication or division:
98 * 91 = 9038 (not helpful)
89 * 91 = 8189 (not helpful either)
(98 * 91) / 91 = 98 (still not 96)
(98 * 91) / 89 = 77.75 (not an integer)
(98 * 89) / 91 = 89.937 (not 96)
Let's try subtraction and addition in different orders:
98 - 91 + 89 = 96
This gives us 96, which is correct. So we can use:
98 - 91 + 89 = 96
</think>
<answer> 98 - 91 + 89 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 16, 84, and 22. We need to use each number exactly once to create an equation that equals 46.
One way to approach this is to look at combinations of the operations we can use. A useful strategy is to see if we can form part of the target number (46) by combining some of these numbers.
Let's try some combinations:
1. \( 84 - 22 - 16 = 46 \)
   - This combination uses all three numbers exactly once and gives us the result 46.
2. Checking if there are other possibilities, like using division or addition/subtraction in different orders, we find that:
   - \( 84 + 16 - 22 = 84 + 4 = 88 \) (not 46)
   - \( 84 - 16 + 22 = 68 + 22 = 90 \) (not 46)
   - \( 16 + 84 - 22 = 16 + 62 = 78 \) (not 46)
Therefore, the combination \( 84 - 22 - 16 \) is valid and gives us the target number 46.
</think>
<answer> 84 - 22 - 16 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 43, 8, and 94. We need to use each exactly once to get a result of 59 using basic arithmetic operations.
We can try different combinations:
- Adding and subtracting: 43 + 8 - 94 = -23 (not 59)
- Subtracting and adding: 94 - 43 - 8 = 43 (not 59)
- Multiplying and adding: 43 * 8 + 94 = 344 + 94 = 438 (not 59)
- Multiplying and subtracting: 94 * 8 - 43 = 752 - 43 = 709 (not 59)
- Mixing operations: (94 - 43) * 8 / 10 = 51 * 8 / 10 = 408 / 10 = 40. 8 (not 59)
None of these combinations work. Let's try a different approach:
(94 - 43) + 8 = 51 + 8 = 59 (This works)
So the equation is: (94 - 43) + 8 = 59.
</think>
<answer> (94 - 43) + 8 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's examine the numbers we have: 43, 8, and 94. We need to create an equation using these numbers only once and the allowed operations to get 59.
We can try different combinations:
- 94 - 43 = 51 (not 59)
- 94 - 8 = 86 (not 59)
- 43 - 8 = 35 (not 59)
- 94 - (43 - 8) = 59 (This is a potential candidate)
- 94 + 8 = 102 (not 59)
- 43 + 8 = 51 (not 59)
From the above, the combination 94 - (43 - 8) equals 59.
</think>
<answer> 94 - (43 - 8) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 91, 78, and 70. We need to create an equation that equals 99 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
One approach is to look at the differences between the numbers:
91 - 78 = 13
78 - 70 = 8
91 - 70 = 21
None of these differences directly give us 99, so we need to combine them in some way.
Another approach is to add some numbers:
91 + 70 = 161
78 is greater than 99, so we can't use 161 by itself either.
We need to look at multiplication or division:
91 * 70 / 78 does not yield a straightforward 99 either.
The trick seems to be combining 78 and 21 from above:
78 + 21 = 99
Now we have used all the numbers exactly once and we get the target number:
91 + 70 - 78 = 99
But this doesn't use all numbers or operations effectively.
Therefore, the correct solution is actually combining 91 - 70 and 78:
91 - 70 + 78 = 99
This equation correctly uses all numbers once and results in 99. </think>
<answer> 91 - 70 + 78 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 77, 66, and 88. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once that equals 55.
Let's try different combinations:
- 77 - 66 = 11
- 77 - 88 = -11
- 66 - 77 = -11
- 88 - 77 = 11
- 77 + 66 = 143
- 66 + 88 = 154
None of these give us 55. Now let's try combinations with different operations:
- (88 - 77) + 66 = 1 + 66 = 67
- (88 - 66) + 77 = 22 + 77 = 99
- 88 + 66 - 77 = 154 - 77 = 77
- 88 + 77 - 66 = 165 - 66 = 99
- 88 - 66 + 77 = 22 + 77 = 99
It seems there is no straightforward combination of these numbers using only +, -, *, / once that results in 55. However, let's try another simpler approach:
- 88 / (77 - 66) = 88 / 11 = 8
- 66 / (77 - 88) = 66 / (-11) = -6
- 77 / (88 - 66) = 77 / 22 = 3.5
None of these give us 55 either. Let’s try:
- (88 - 66) / 77 = 22 / 77 = 22/77 (which is not 55)
- 88 / (77 + 66) = 88 / 143 (which is not 55 either)
Finally, let's try:
- (88 - 66) / 77 = 22 / 77 (which isn't 55)
- 77 + 66 - 88 (77 + 66 - 88) = 77 + 66 - 88 = 143 - 88 = 55
Although 77 + 66 - 88 equals 55, it uses the numbers more than once. Since every number must be used only once, it seems we cannot create the equation 55 with the provided numbers. Thus, no valid equation can be formed under these constraints.
</think>
<answer> 77 + 66 - 88 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 20, 72, and 3. We need to create an equation that equals 89 using each number only once and basic arithmetic operations.
One effective way to approach this might be to use multiplication and addition. Notice that:
72 * 3 = 216
However, this doesn't help us reach 89.
Now let's try combining the numbers differently:
(72 + 20) - 3
This simplifies to:
92 - 3 = 89
This gives us the result we need.
Therefore, the equation is (72 + 20) - 3 = 89.
</think>
<answer> (72 + 20) - 3 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 74, 86, and 35. We need to create an equation that equals 47 using each number exactly once.
Let's try different combinations of operations:
- 86 - 74 = 12, and then 12 + 35 = 47, but we only use numbers 74, 86 once.
- 74 + 35 = 109, which is too large.
- 86 + 35 = 121, which is also too large.
- 86 - 35 = 51, and then 51 - 74 = -24, so this combination is not right.
- 74 + 86 = 160, which is too large.
- 86 - 74 = 12, and then 12 * 35 = 420, which is way too large.
- 86 - 74 = 12, but we can't use 74 again.
Let's try another approach:
- 74 + 35 = 109, which is too large.
- 86 - 35 = 51, and then 51 - 74 = -24, so incorrect again.
A different way:
- 74 * 35 = 2590
- 86 - 2590 / 35 = 47
So, (86 - (74 * 35) / 35) = 47
However, if we break out 35 / 35, it simplifies to 1, we would have (86 - 74) = 12, which doesn't get us to 47.
Reworking it, the actual equation we need is simpler yet:
- 74 + 86 - 35 = 125
This is wrong approach, let's try:
- 86 - 74 = 12, as mentioned, and then 12 + 35 = 47 - successful.
Correct Formulate:
(86 - 74) + 35 = 47
</think>
<answer>(86 - 74) + 35</answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to create an equation that uses the numbers 74, 86, and 35 exactly once to result in 47.
Let's try different combinations:
- 86 - 74 = 12, which is too small.
- 86 - 35 = 51, which is too large.
- 74 + 35 = 109, which is too large.
- 86 + 35 = 121, which is too large.
- 74 + 86 = 160, which is too large.
It seems like simple addition and subtraction are not working. Let's try multiplication and division:
- 86 * 35 / 74 = 39.94, which is close but not exact.
- 35 * 86 / 74 = 42.75, which is also not exact.
We need to re-evaluate simpler combinations:
- 86 - 35 - 74 = -23 (too low)
- 86 - 74 = 12, then 12 + 35 = 47 (this works).
So, the equation 86 - 74 + 35 = 47 satisfies the condition.
</think>
<answer> 86 - 74 + 35 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 56, 12, 18, and 12. We need to create an equation that equals 98 using each number only once.
One effective way to approach this is to add or subtract numbers and see if we can use the result along with another operation to reach 98.
If we add 56 and 12, we get 68. Now, we need 30 more to reach 98. We can get 30 by adding 18 and 12.
So the equation becomes: 56 + 12 + 18 + 12 = 98.
Let's verify: 56 + 12 = 68, then 68 + 18 = 86, and finally 86 + 12 = 98.
This satisfies the condition of using each number exactly once and results in 98.
</think>
<answer> 56 + 12 + 18 + 12 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 38, 7, 17, and 18. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 46.
One way to approach this is to look at how we can combine these numbers using addition and subtraction.
If we add 38 and 18, we get 56.
If we subtract 7 and 17, we get 0.
But since we need exactly 46, let's try subtracting 0 from 56.
However, subtracting 17 and 7 will give us 0, and adding it to 38 will not get us 46.
Now let's try: 38 - 17 = 21, and 21 + 7 = 28, and finally 28 + 18 = 46.
So the equation is 38 - 17 + 7 + 18 = 46.
</think>
<answer> 38 - 17 + 7 + 18 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 51, 94, and 57. We need to create an equation that equals 14 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
- We know that 94 is the largest number, so it's logical to consider how we can use the other two numbers in relation to it.
- Let's try to subtract or add 51 and 57 to see if we can get close to 14.
- If we subtract 57 from 94, we get 37, which is far from 14.
- If we add 51 and 57, we get 108, which is also not 14.
- Let's try another combination: 94 - 57 - 51. This results in -14, which is close but doesn't use all the numbers.
- Now, let's try a different approach: 94 - 57 + 51. This gives us 94 - 57 = 37, then 37 + 51 = 88, which is still not 14.
- It seems tricky to achieve 14, so let's try combinations with different operations. Multiplying and dividing might give us a chance:
- 94 * 57 / 51. Let's calculate this: 94 * 57 = 5358, and 5358 / 51 = 105.666..., which isn't 14.
- Looking back, we missed simpler combinations. Consider 94 - 57 - (51 / 57) might work. But that involves division and complex steps not fitting basic operations constraint.
- Another likely route: 51 + 57 - 94. Calculating this: 51 + 57 = 108, then 108 - 94 = 14.
This last combination works using all operations simply.
</think>
<answer> 51 + 57 - 94 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers 18, 30, and 89. We need to create an equation using these numbers only once to get 77.
We can start by looking at the possible combinations:
- 18 + 30 + 89 = 137 (This is too high)
- 18 + 30 - 89 = -41 (This is too low)
- 18 + 89 - 30 = 77 (This looks promising)
- 30 + 89 - 18 = 101 (This is too high)
- 89 - 30 + 18 = 77 (This is the same as the second promising combination, but in a different order)
So, the valid and unique equation using all three numbers is 18 + 89 - 30 = 77.
</think>
<answer> 18 + 89 - 30 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to create an equation using the numbers 1, 78, and 45 that equals 34. We can try different combinations of arithmetic operations.
- Adding and subtracting these numbers: 78 + 45 + 1 = 124, which is too large.
- Subtracting the numbers: 78 - 45 - 1 = 32, we're close but still slightly off.
- Combining with multiplication or division: 78 * 45 = 3510 (way too large), 45 * 1 = 45 (too small), 78 * 1 = 78 (too large), 45 / 1 = 45 (too large), 78 / 45 (not an integer, so no good), 1 * 45 + 78 = 123 (too large), 1 * 78 + 45 = 123 (too large)
After considering these possibilities, we find that a combination of uses all numbers exactly once:
78 - 45 + 1 = 34
</think>
<answer> 78 - 45 + 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 20, 46, and 31. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once to equal 35.
- Let's try adding and subtracting: 46 - 20 - 31 = -9 (doesn't work)
- Now let's try another combination: 46 + 20 - 31 = 35
This combination works because 46 + 20 equals 66, and then subtracting 31 gives us 35.
</think>
<answer> 46 + 20 - 31 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers 73, 15, 86, and 92. We need to create an equation that equals 82 using each number exactly once.
- Adding the numbers: 73 + 15 + 86 + 92 = 266 (This is too large)
- Subtracting: We need to find a combination that results in 82, like 92 - something or 86 - something - something else
- Multiplication or division would make the result even more unmanageable given the numbers available.
Let's try 92 - 73 - 15 - 86
92 - 73 = 19
19 - 15 = 4
4 - 86 is clearly negative and doesn't help.
Let's try another combination: 92 - 86 - 15 + 73
92 - 86 = 6
6 - 15 = -9
-9 + 73 = 64 (Still too large)
Let's try: 86 + 15 - 73 + 92
86 + 15 = 101
101 - 73 = 28
28 + 92 = 120 (Still too large)
Let's try combining 73 + 92 - 15 - 86
73 + 92 = 165
165 - 15 = 150 (Still too large)
Let's try 86 - 15 + 73 + 92 :
86 - 15 = 71
71 + 73 = 144 (Still too large)
Finally, consider 86 + 15 + 73 - 92
86 + 15 = 101
101 + 73 = 174
174 - 92 = 82
This gives us the correct result of 82 using each number only once.
</think>
<answer> 86 + 15 + 73 - 92 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 78, 65, and 85. We need to create an equation using these numbers only once and combining them using basic arithmetic operations to get 98.
- Adding 78 and 85 gives us 163.
- Then subtracting 65 from 163 gives us 98.
So the equation would be: 78 + 85 - 65 = 98.
</think>
<answer> 78 + 85 - 65 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 70, 93, and 7. We need to create an equation that equals 30 using each number exactly once and only basic arithmetic operations.
We can try different combinations:
- 70 + 93 + 7 = 170 (too high)
- 93 - 70 + 7 = 27 (too low)
- 93 + 70 - 7 = 166 (too high)
- 70 - 93 + 7 = -16 (too low)
- 93 - 70 - 7 = 16 (too low)
- 70 + 93 - 7 = 156 (too high)
Now, let's try a combination keeping 70 and 93 together but adding and subtracting in a different way:
70 + (93 - 7) = 70 + 86 = 156 (still too high)
Since none of the simple combinations seem to work, let's try combining the numbers in a different way:
(93 - 70) + 7 = 23 + 7 = 30
So, the equation that works is:
(93 - 70) + 7 = 30
</think>
<answer> (93 - 70) + 7 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 64, 54, and 68. We need to create an equation using these numbers just once each to equal 78. We can try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- If we add 64 and 54, we get 118, which is too high.
- If we subtract 64 from 68, we get 2, which when added to 54 gives 58, still too low.
- If we subtract 54 from 68, we get 14, which when added to 64 gives 78, this seems promising.
So, the equation could be: 68 - 54 + 64 = 78.
</think>
<answer> 68 - 54 + 64 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 64, 54, and 68. We need to create an equation that equals 78 using each number exactly once and only basic arithmetic operations.
- One approach is to try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Let's start with the largest number, 68, and see what we can do with the other two: 64 and 54.
- 68 + 54 = 122 (which is too high)
- 68 + 64 = 132 (also too high)
- 68 + 54 - 64 = 58 (still too high)
- 68 - 54 + 64 = 78 (this seems promising)
- 68 - 64 + 54 = 58 (not quite 78)
- 64 + 54 - 68 = 50 (too low)
- 54 + 64 - 68 = 48 (too low)
- 54 + 68 - 64 = 68 (not quite 78)
From these calculations, it's clear that 68 - 54 + 64 equals 78.

<answer> 68 - 54 + 64 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 21, 19, and 22. We need to create an equation that equals 18 using each of these numbers exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
- Let's try combinations using addition and subtraction:
  - 22 + 19 = 41, which is far from 18
  - 22 + 19 - 21 = 20, still not 18
  - 22 + 19 - 1 = 38, also far from 18
  - Now, let's try different pairings:
  - 22 + 19 - 21 = 20 (which was already tested)
  - 21 + 19 - 22 = 18, this could work.
So, the equation is 21 + 19 - 22 = 18.
</think>
<answer> 21 + 19 - 22 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 12, 71, and 66. We need to combine these numbers using basic arithmetic operations to get the result of 17. 
- One possible way is to think about subtraction. If we subtract a smaller number from a larger one, we can get a solution close to our target.
- If we subtract 66 from 71, we get 5. Then we need 12 to reach 17, but we can't simply add 12 because we've already used this number.
- Instead, let's try another combination: 71 - 66 = 5, and then we need 12 - 5 = 7, but this doesn't work as we don't have another way to achieve this.
- Now, let's try 71 - 12 = 59 and then 59 - 66 = -7, which is not 17.
- Another combination that we haven't tried is using addition and subtraction first: 71 - 12 + 66 = 125, which is far from 17, but helps us to visualize the process.
- Finally, let's try 71 + 12 - 66 = 17. This works because 71 + 12 equals 83, and then subtracting 66 gives 17.
</think>
<answer> 71 + 12 - 66 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 78, 74, and 65. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get 61.
We can start by subtracting the smallest number from the sum of the other two:
(78 + 74) - 65 = 152 - 65 = 87
This is not 61, so this approach doesn't work.
Let's try another combination: using subtraction between the largest and smallest numbers and adding the middle one:
78 - 65 + 74 = 13 + 74 = 87
This also doesn't give us 61.
Now let's try another combination: using subtraction between the largest and middle numbers and adding the smallest one:
78 - 74 + 65 = 4 + 65 = 69
This result of 69 is still not 61.
Finally, let's try using multiplication and subtraction: we can use 74 * 87 (which isn't 61) but if we consider simpler and basic options:
78 - (74 - 65) = 78 - 9 = 69
This is still not 61.
Let's try a different approach: 
By trying (78-74) * 65/100 derivative, we probably need 100 way simplified. 
(78 - 74) / (65/100) = 4 / 1. 32 (improper simplifying)
Therefore, a feasible valid operation can be:
(78 - 74) + (65 - 10) = 4 + 55 = 59
Otherwise, simple solutions are commonly applied:
Ideal equation used here simplifying ready:
(78 - 74) + 65/2 = 4 + 32. 5 (complex)
So far, (65-74)+78/2 (fails)
Let's fulfill in simplest, intuitively:
(78*2) - (74+65) = 156 - 139 = 17
Also application directly:
78-(74+65/2) = 78-(74+32. 5) = 78-106. 5 = -28
Finally, direct simple:
78-(65+74/2) = 78-(65+37)=78-102 = -24
78-65=13, then 13*3/1=39 and -23
Correctly simplest is:
(78-65)+74/2 = (78-65)+(74/2)=13+37 = 50 simple
So, the correct simplification gives:
(65+74)-78=139-78=61
Final means: 139-78=61

<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 50, 91, and 55. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to equal 96.
We can look at the numbers and try different combinations of arithmetic operations.
50 + 91 = 141
141 - 55 = 86
This gives us 86, which is close but not quite 96.
Let's try another approach:
91 - 50 = 41
41 + 55 = 96
This combination works, using each number exactly once.

<answer> 91 - 50 + 55 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 50, 91, and 55. We need to use each number exactly once to make the equation equal 96.
Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
- 91 - 50 - 55 = -14 (not 96)
- 91 - 50 + 55 = 96 (this could work)
- 50 + 91 - 55 = 86 (not 96)
- 50 + 55 - 91 = 14 (not 96)
- 91 * 50 / 55 = 82. 71 (not 96)
The combination 91 - 50 + 55 does indeed equal 96. Therefore, the equation is 91 - 50 + 55 = 96.

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 50, 91, and 55. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 96.
We can try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:

- 91 + 55 - 50 = 96 (this seems to work)
- 50 + 91 - 55 = 86 (not 96)
- 55 + 91 - 50 = 96 (this works too)
Both 91 + 55 - 50 and 55 + 91 - 50 equal 96. However, the instruction asks for one way, so we can choose either.

<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 30, 70, 82, and 44. We need to arrange these numbers using basic arithmetic operations to get 26. 
We can start by trying different combinations:
- Adding and subtracting: (70 + 30 - 82) = 18 (not 26)
- Trying combination with 44: (70 + 30 - 44) = 56 (not 26), (82 - 70 + 30) = 42 (not 26)
- Another approach: (82 - 70) + 30 - 44 = 12 + 30 - 44 = 42 - 44 = -2 (not 26)
- Let's try another: 82 - (70 + 30 - 44) = 82 - 66 = 16 (not 26)
- Finally, let's try: 70 - (30 - 82 + 44) = 70 - (-36) = 70 + 36 = 106 (not 26)
- Now, let's try: (82 - 70 + 44 - 30) = 12 + 14 = 26. This looks promising.
Therefore, the equation that works is 82 - 70 + 44 - 30 = 26.</think>

<think> First, let's analyze the numbers we have: 65, 9, and 36. We need to create an equation that equals 92 using each number exactly once with the operators +, -, *, and /. Let's try different combinations:
- Adding 65 and 9 gives us 74, which is not 92.
- Adding 65 and 36 gives us 101, which is too high.
- Subtracting 9 from 65 gives us 56, then adding 36 gives us 92. This looks promising.
So the equation would be: (65 - 9) + 36 = 92.
</think>
<answer> (65 - 9) + 36 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 21, 59, and 16. We need to create an equation using these numbers only once, with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), that results in 54.
- One way to approach this is to try combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with the three numbers.
- Let's start by adding 21 and 16: 21 + 16 = 37.
- Now we need a number that, when added to or subtracted from 37, gives us 54.
- If we try 59 - 37: 59 - 37 = 22, which is not 54.
- Instead, let's try subtracting 37 from 59: 59 - 37 = 22, which again isn't 54.
- Now let's try adding 37 to 21 to get 52, and then add 2 more to reach 54: 21 + 16 + (59 - 37) = 21 + 16 + 22, but 22 is not the correct supplement to reach 54 from 52.
- Let's try another approach: 59 - 21 = 38, and then find out how to get to 54 with this.
- Now we subtract 38 from 59 to directly achieve 54: 59 - 21 = 38, and then 59 - 38 = 21, but we need 54.
- Another way to look at it: 59 - 21 = 38, 16 + 26 = 54 (but we can't use 26 with the given numbers).
- Let's try 59 - (21 + 16): 59 - 37 = 22, not 54. 
- Let's try 59 - 21 = 38 again and add 26 directly using an alternative operation:
Therefore, after all these iterations, a valid combination is 59 - (21 - 16) = 59 - 5 = 54.
</think>
<answer> 59 - (21 - 16) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 35, 82, 79, and 27. We need to create an equation that equals 65 using each number exactly once.
We can try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
- 82 - 35 - 27 = 20 is not 65
- 82 - 35 + 27 = 74 is not 65
- 82 + 35 - 27 = 90 is not 65
- 82 + 35 + 27 = 144 is not 65
- 79 + 35 - 27 = 87 is not 65
- 79 - 35 + 27 = 71 is not 65
- 79 + 35 + 27 = 141 is not 65
- 79 + 82 - 27 = 134 is not 65
- 82 + 79 - 35 = 126 is not 65
- 82 - 79 + 35 = 38 is not 65
- 79 - 82 + 35 = 32 is not 65
- 82 + 79 + 27 = 188 is not 65
- 79 + 82 + 27 = 190 is not 65
After trying various combinations, we find:
- 82 + 79 - 35 = 126 - 35 = 91 is not 65
- 79 + 82 - 27 = 161 - 27 = 134 is not 65
- 79 + 35 - 27 = 84 - 27 = 57 is not 65
- Finally, 82 + (79 - 35) = 82 + 44 = 126 is not 65
- 79 + 35 + 27 - 82 = 111 + 27 - 82 = 138 - 82 = 56 is not 65
Finally, we found the combination:
82 + 79 - 27 = 161 - 27 = 134 is not 65
Thus, the proper combination turns out to be:
79 + 35 + 27 - 82 = 111 + 27 - 82 = 138 - 82 = 56 is not 65
The correct equation is:
35 + (82 + 27 - 79)
This gives:
35 + 109 - 79 = 65
Therefore, the equation is 35 + 82 + 27 - 79 = 65 </think>
<answer> 35 + 82 + 27 - 79 </answer>

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 35, 82, 79, and 27. We need to create an equation that equals 65 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
- Let's try to use subtraction to get closer to 65. For example, 82 - 35 = 47.
- Now we need 18 more to reach 65 (since 47 + 18 = 65). We can get 18 by subtracting 27 from 79 (79 - 27 = 52, but this uses both 79 and 27 which can't both be used separately).
- So, let's consider: 82 - 35 + (79 - 27)
- Simplifying this, we get: 47 + 52 = 99, which isn't 65.
- Let's try another combination: 82 - 79 + 35
- Simplifying this, we get: 3 + 35 = 38, which isn't 65 either.
- Another attempt: 82 - 79 - 35 + 27
- Simplifying this, we get: 3 - 35 + 27 = -32 + 27 = -5, which isn't 65.
- One final try: 82 - 79 + 27 - 35
- Simplifying this, we get: 3 + 27 - 35 = 30 - 35 = -5, which isn't 65.
- It seems none of the above combinations work.
- Let's reconsider the possibilities more creatively. Let's try: 82 + 27 - 79 - 35
- Simplifying this, we get: 109 - 114 = -5, which isn't 65.
- We need to find the correct combination. Let's try: 82 - (35 + 27) + 79
- Simplifying this, we get: 82 - 62 + 79 = 20 + 79 = 99, which isn't 65.
- Finally, let's try: (82 - 79) + 27 + 35
- Simplifying this, we get: 3 + 27 + 35 = 30 + 35 = 65.
This combination works.
</think>
<answer>(82 - 79) + 27 + 35</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 46, 65, 15, and 14. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once that equals 82.
- Adding and subtracting these numbers doesn't seem to get us close to 82.
- Multiplying 46 by any of the others gives us 46*15=690, 46*14=644, or 46*65=2990, which are all too large or too small.
- Let's try combining them in different ways:
  - 46 + 65 + 15 + 14 = 139 (too large)
  - 65 + 15 + 14 = 94 (too large)
  - 46 + 65 - 15 - 14 = 92 (too large)
  - 65 + 15 - 46 - 14 = 19 (too small)
  - 46 + 15 - 14 + 65 = 112 (too large)
  - 46 + 65 - 14 - 15 = 102 (too large)
  - 15 + 14 + 46 + 65 = 139 (too large)
  Now, let's try rearranging:
  - 46 - 14 + 65 - 15 = 82
This combination works as it gives us the correct result of 82.
</think>
<answer> 46 - 14 + 65 - 15 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 63, 49, and 94. We need to create an equation that equals 80 using each number exactly once and the basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by looking at combinations of the numbers:
- 63 + 49 = 112
- 94 - 63 = 31
- 94 - 49 = 45
- 63 + 49 - 94 = 18
- 94 + 49 - 63 = 80
Here, we see that using 94 + 49 - 63 gives us 80, and each number is used exactly once.
</think>
<answer> 94 + 49 - 63 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 21, 16, and 71. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once that equals 34.
- One way to approach this is to look at combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Let's try combining 21 and 16 first: 21 + 16 = 37, which is close but not 34.
- Now, let's try 71 - 21 = 50, which is far from 34.
- Next, let's try 71 - 16 = 55, which is again not 34.
- Let's try a combination that includes all three numbers: 71 - 21 - 16 = 34. Here we are using subtraction, and it seems to work.
- Therefore, the equation 71 - 21 - 16 = 34 is correct.
</think>
<answer> 71 - 21 - 16 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 69, 50, and 60. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations, to get a result of 59.
One way to approach this is to explore combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Let's try 69 - 50 + 60:
69 - 50 = 19
19 + 60 = 79
This doesn't give us 59.
Next, let's try 69 - 60 + 50:
69 - 60 = 9
9 + 50 = 59
This gives us the desired result of 59.
So, the equation is 69 - 60 + 50 = 59.
</think>
<answer> 69 - 60 + 50 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 5, 28, 11, and 61. We need to create an equation that equals 95 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try different combinations:
- 5 + 28 + 11 + 61 = 105 (which is too high)
- 28 + 11 + 61 + 5 = 105 (again too high)
- 61 + 28 + 5 + 11 = 105 (too high)
- 28 + 61 + 11 + 5 = 105 (too high)
- Let's try combining them differently:
- (61 + 28) - (11 + 5) = 89 - 16 = 73
This is not right. Let's adjust:
- 61 + 28 + 11 - 5 = 105 - 16 = 89
Still not right. Let's try:
- 61 + (28 - 5) + 11 = 61 + 23 + 11 = 95
This works perfectly!
</think>
<answer> 61 + (28 - 5) + 11 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 47, 80, and 67. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 60.
- Adding 47 and 67 gives us 114.
- Subtracting 80 from 114 would give us 34, which is not 60.
- Subtracting 67 from 80 gives us 13.
- Now, if we add this result to 47, we get 47 + 13 = 60.
So, the equation becomes 80 - 67 + 47 = 60.
</think>
<answer> 80 - 67 + 47 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 70, 63, and 40. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get 47.
- Let's try different combinations using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- If we start with subtraction: 70 - 63 = 7. Now we need 39 more to reach 47. We don't have 39 here.
- Next, let's try 70 - 40 = 30. Now we need 17 more to reach 47. Again, we don't have 17.
- Let's try 63 - 40 = 23. We need 24 more to reach 47. We don't have 24.
- Now, let's try multiplication and addition: 70 * 63 / 40 = 44.55, which is not 47.
- Trying 70 + 63 / 40 = 70 + 1.575 = 71.575, which is not 47.
- Let's try a different combination: 70 + 40 - 63 = 47. This gives us the required result.
So, 70 + 40 - 63 equals 47.
</think>
<answer> 70 + 40 - 63 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 39, 80, and 44. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 85.
- One way to approach this is to try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Let's try adding and subtracting these numbers:
  - 80 + 44 - 39 = 114 - 39 = 75 (This is not 85)
  - Let's try another combination:
  - 80 + 39 - 44 = 119 - 44 = 75 (Still not 85)
  - Now, let's try multiplication and addition:
  - 80 + (44 * 1) = 80 + 44 = 124 (This is too high)
  - Let's also try:
  - 80 - (44 * 1) = 80 - 44 = 36 (Too low)
  - Now, let's consider: 
  - (80 - 39) + 44 = 41 + 44 = 85 (This gives us 85)
So, the equation (80 - 39) + 44 equals 85.
</think>
<answer> (80 - 39) + 44 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to create an equation using the numbers 68, 52, and 68 that equals 52. Each number can only be used once.
- If we subtract 68 from 68, we get 0. This doesn't help us reach 52.
- We can try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Let's try: 68 - 68 + 52
This simplifies to: 0 + 52 = 52
This equation uses all three numbers exactly once and equals 52.
</think>
<answer> 68 - 68 + 52 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 68, 52, and 68. We need to create an equation that uses these numbers only once and results in 52.
We can try different combinations of the numbers and operations:
1. 68 - 68 + 52 = 52
2. 68 + 68 - 52 = 84
3. 52 + 68 - 68 = 52
4. 68 / (68 - 52) = 4 (This doesn't work since 68 - 52 = 16 and 68 / 16 is not an integer)
The equation 68 - 68 + 52 = 52 works because:
68 - 68 = 0
0 + 52 = 52
So, the correct equation is 68 - 68 + 52 = 52.
</think>
<answer> 68 - 68 + 52 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 1, 83, and 69. We need to create an equation that equals 15 using each of these numbers exactly once.
Let's try different combinations of operations:
- Adding and subtracting: 1 + 83 - 69 = 15 (This works)
- Multiplying and dividing: Trying different combinations doesn't lead to 15.
- Using all numbers in a complex expression: This doesn't seem to yield 15 easily.
So, 1 + 83 - 69 is the correct combination that gives us 15.
</think>
<answer> 1 + 83 - 69 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 54, 5, 38, and 8. We need to use each number exactly once to make a valid equation that equals 79.
- Let's try different combinations of operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- One possible approach is to try to get close to 79 using two numbers and then adjust with the other two.
- If we take 54 and 38, their sum is 92, which is close but too high.
- If we subtract 38 from 54, we get 16. Now we need 63 more to reach 79. We can try subtracting 8 from 5 to see if this works: 5 - 8 = -3. This would give us 16 + (-3) = 13, far from 79.
- Next, let's try: 54 + 5 - 38 + 8. This gives us: 54 + 5 = 59, then 59 - 38 = 21, and finally 21 + 8 = 29. Not 79.
- Another approach: 54 - 38 + 5 + 8. This gives us: 54 - 38 = 16, then 16 + 5 = 21, and finally 21 + 8 = 29. Still not 79.
- Finally, let's try: 54 + 38 - 5 - 8. This gives us: 54 + 38 = 92, then 92 - 5 = 87, and finally 87 - 8 = 79. This hits our target.
So, the equation that equals 79 is 54 + 38 - 5 - 8.
</think>
<answer> 54 + 38 - 5 - 8 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 76, 36, and 6. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once that equals 46.
One way to approach this is to explore different combinations of the numbers and operations.
- Addition: 76 + 36 + 6 = 118 (too high)
- Subtraction: 76 - 36 - 6 = 34 (too low)
- Multiplication: 76 * 36 / 6 = 464 (too high)
- Division: 76 / 36 + 6 = 10.611... (not an integer, and too high)
From the above, none of these simple combinations work. Let's try another order:
76 + 36 - 6 = 106 (too high)
76 - 36 + 6 = 46 (matches our target)
So, the equation that works is 76 - 36 + 6 = 46.
</think>
<answer> 76 - 36 + 6 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 76, 36, and 6. We need to create an equation that equals 46 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
One approach is to try combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Let's try different orders:
- 76 - 36 - 6 = 34 (not 46)
- 76 - 36 + 6 = 46 (this could work)
- 76 + 36 - 6 = 106 (not 46)
- 76 + 36 + 6 = 118 (not 46)
- 36 - 76 + 6 = -34 (not 46)
- 36 + 76 - 6 = 106 (not 46)
- 6 + 36 - 76 = -34 (not 46)
From the above calculations, it's clear that 76 - 36 + 6 equals 46. </think>
<answer> 76 - 36 + 6 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 4, 20, and 9. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to equal 71.
We can try different combinations of operations. Let's start with multiplication and addition:
20 * 9 = 180
This is too large, so let's try another order:
4 * 20 = 80
This is also too large. Let's try another combination:
20 + 9 = 29
This is still not 71. Let's try:
20 + 4 = 24
This gets us 24. Now, let's see if we can get to 71 from this:
24 + 47 = 71
We need 47 and we have the number 9 left, which doesn't help us reach 47.
Instead, let's try:
4 * 20 = 80
Then subtract 9:
80 - 9 = 71
This gives us the number 71 using all three numbers exactly once.
</think>
<answer> 4 * 20 - 9 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 11, 3, and 42. We need to create an equation that equals 75 using each number only once and with basic arithmetic operations.
One way to approach this is to look at combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division that might lead us to 75.
Let's try different combinations:
1. 42 + 11 + 3 = 56 (This is less than 75)
2. 42 + 11 - 3 = 50 (Still not 75)
3. 42 + 3 - 11 = 34 (Still not 75)
4. Now let's try multiplication and addition: (42 * 3) + 11 = 126 + 11 = 137 (Too large)
5. Let's try another possibility: (42 * 11) - 3 = 462 - 3 = 459 (Too large)
6. A different combination: 42 - (11 - 3) = 42 - 8 = 34 (Still not 75)
Finally, let's try this:
(42 * 3) + 11 = 126 + 11 = 137 (We missed simply 42 + (11 * 3))
So: 42 + (11 * 3) = 42 + 33 = 75
</think>
<answer> 42 + (11 * 3) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 96, 89, and 94. We need to use each number exactly once and combine them using basic arithmetic operations to get the result of 87.
- One way to approach this is to try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Let's start with subtraction: 96 - 89 = 7. Then we need 87 - 7 = 80, which doesn't use the number 94.
- Next, let's try multiplication: 96 * 94 = 9024, which is far too large.
- Now, let's try a combination like: (96 - 94) + 89 = 2 + 89 = 91, which is also not 87.
- Let's try another combination: 96 - (94 - 89) = 96 - 5 = 91, which is still not 87.
- Now, let's try a different way: Let's take 94 - 89 = 5, then use this result with the other numbers: 96 - 5 = 91, which is again not 87.
- It seems more promising to use all numbers directly in addition: 96 + 89 + 94 = 280. This is too large as well.
- Let's recheck the basic combinations:
  - 96 + 94 - 89 = 190 - 89 = 101, not 87.
  - 96 - 94 + 89 = 2 + 89 = 91, not 87.
  - 94 + 89 - 96 = 183 - 96 = 87, which matches our target.
Hence, one valid combination is 94 + 89 - 96 = 87.
</think>
<answer> 94 + 89 - 96 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 43, 74, and 91. Our goal is to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get a result of 60.
We can try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- 74 - 91 + 43 = -74 + 43 = -31 (not 60)
- 91 - 74 + 43 = 17 + 43 = 60 (This seems to work)
So we have a potential solution with the equation: 91 - 74 + 43 = 60.
</think>
<answer> 91 - 74 + 43 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 43, 74, and 91. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once that equals 60.
We can start by adding 43 and 74:
43 + 74 = 117
This gives us close to 60 but much too large.
Next, let's try subtracting 91 from 117:
117 - 91 = 26
This is still not 60.
Now, let's try a different combination. Let's subtract 74 from 91:
91 - 74 = 17
This is still not 60.
Now, let's try combining these with multiplication or division. We notice that 91 * 43 = 3893, which is far too large, and 43 * 74 = 3182, which is also too large. 
Now, let's try a combination that I haven't yet tried: 43 + (91 - 74)
43 + (91 - 74) = 43 + 17 = 60
This works! We are now able to use 43, 74, and 91 exactly once to make 60 with the equation 43 + (91 - 74).
</think>
<answer> 43 + (91 - 74) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 50, 58, and 48. We need to create an equation that equals 40 using each number exactly once.
We can try different combinations of operations:
- Adding or subtracting, multiplying, or dividing these numbers doesn't immediately jump out as giving us 40.
- Let's try combining some numbers with division:
  - 58 - 50 = 8
  - 8 + 48 = 56 (which isn't 40)
- Let's try another combination:
  - 50 + 48 = 98
  - 98 - 58 = 40 (this gives us 40)
So the equation 50 + 48 - 58 equals 40.
</think>
<answer> 50 + 48 - 58 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 21, 84, and 87. We need to use each number exactly once to make the equation equal 91 using basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by looking at the possible combinations:
- Adding or subtracting 21 and 84: 21 + 84 = 105, 21 - 84 = -63
- Adding or subtracting 21 and 87: 21 + 87 = 108, 21 - 87 = -66
- Adding or subtracting 84 and 87: 84 + 87 = 171, 84 - 87 = -3
None of these produce 91.
Now let's consider multiplying or dividing:
- Multiplying 21 and 84: 21 * 84 = 1764
- Multiplying 21 and 87: 21 * 87 = 1827
- Multiplying 84 and 87: 84 * 87 = 7398
- Dividing 84 by 21: 84 / 21 = 4
- Dividing 87 by 21: This doesn't result in an integer
None of these either produce 91.
Now let's try a different approach, maybe we can use mixed operations:
Considering 87 - 21 = 66, then adding 84 to 66:
87 - 21 + 84 = 66 + 84 = 150, which is still not 91.
87 - 21 * 84 = 87 - 1764 = -1677, which is not 91.
84 - 21 + 87 = 65 + 87 = 152, which is still not 91.
87 / 21 + 84 = 4 + 84 = 88, which is still not 91.
But, we have another combination:
Considering 84 * 87 / 21:
First calculate 84 * 87 = 7356
Then 7356 / 21 = 350. 29
This is not 91.
84 / 21 + 87 = 4 + 87 = 91
Hence, the correct operations would be: 84 / 21 + 87 = 91.
</think>
<answer> 84 / 21 + 87 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the given numbers: 84, 57, 63, and 20. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once to get 70.
- We can start by looking at the possible combinations of these numbers with basic arithmetic operations.
- Adding and subtracting these numbers do not seem to yield 70 quickly.
- Let's try a multiplication and addition: (84 * 63) + 57 + 20 would be too large.
- Next, let's try 63 - 57 + 84 + 20:
  - 63 - 57 = 6
  - 6 + 84 = 90
  - 90 + 20 = 110, which is still too large.
- Let's try another combination: (84 + 57) + 63 + 20:
  - 84 + 57 = 141
  - 141 + 63 = 204, which is too large.
- Now, let's try another simple combination: (84 + 20) + 63 - 57:
  - 84 + 20 = 104
  - 104 + 63 = 167
  - 167 - 57 = 110, which is too large.
- Finally, let's try: (84 - 63) + 57 + 20:
  - 84 - 63 = 21
  - 21 + 57 = 78
  - 78 + 20 = 98, which is still too large.
- We haven't found the right combination, so let's try: (84 - 63) + 57 + 20:
  - 84 - 63 = 21
  - 21 + 57 = 78
  - 78 + 20 = 98, which is still too large.
- Still need to recheck: (84 - 63) + 57 + 20:
  - 84 - 63 = 21
  - 21 + 57 = 78
  - 78 + 20 = 98, which is still too large.
- Trying a different approach: 84 - (57 + 63) + 20:
  - 57 + 63 = 120
  - 84 - 120 = -36
  - -36 + 20 = -16, which is not 70.
- Still not right. Let's try: 84 + 57 - 63 - 20.
  - 84 + 57 = 141
  - 141 - 63 = 78
  - 78 - 20 = 58, which is close but not 70.
- Trying 84 - (57 + 63 - 20) lacks a close approximation.
- Trying (84 + 63 - 57) - 20:
  - 84 + 63 = 147
  - 147 - 57 = 90, 
  - 90 - 20 = 70, which is perfect.
So the correct equation is: (84 + 63) - 57 - 20 = 70.
</think>
<answer>(84 + 63) - 57 - 20</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 65, 87, and 53. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to equal 75.
We can try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
65 + 87 = 152 (This is too large)
87 + 53 = 140 (This is very large)
65 + 53 = 118 (This is also too large)
87 - 53 = 34 (This is too small)
65 - 53 = 12 (This is too small)
65 * 53 / 87 = 41. 75 (This doesn't give 75)
Now let's try 87 - 65 = 22, and then 22 + 53 = 75.
So, the equation is 87 - 65 + 53 = 75.
</think>
<answer> 87 - 65 + 53 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's examine the numbers we have: 56, 71, and 27. We need to create an equation that equals 100 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
One approach is to consider the operations that might make the numbers combine to reach 100. We can try different combinations:
56 + 71 = 127 (which is too high)
56 + 27 = 83 (which is too low)
71 + 27 = 98 (which is also too low)
Let's try a different combination:
71 - 56 = 15
Now we need 85 more to reach 100:
85 + 27 = 112 (which is too high)
This doesn't work. Let's try another:
56 - 27 = 29
Now we need 71 more to reach 100:
71 + 29 = 100
So the equation would be 56 - 27 + 71 = 100.
</think>
<answer> 56 - 27 + 71 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 92, 1, 14, 14. We need to create an equation that uses these numbers exactly once to get the result of 93.
- If we look at 92 + 1 = 93, this works, but we would have used only two numbers and left two unused.
- Let's try another combination: 92 + 14 - 14 = 92 + 0 = 92, which is not 93.
- Now let's try 92 + 14 + 1 - 14. Here, +14 + 1 = 15 and 92 + 15 - 14 = 92 + 1 - 14 = 93. But this rearranges 1 and 14.
- Another possibility is 92 - 14 + 1 + 14. Here, 92 - 14 = 78 and then 78 + 1 + 14 = 93.
Thus, 92 - 14 + 1 + 14 equals 93, using each number only once.
</think>
<answer> 92 - 14 + 1 + 14 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 89, 37, and 78. We need to create an equation that equals 48 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
- Let's try combining the numbers in different ways, using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- If we add 37 and 78, we get 115, which is too high. Then if we subtract 89 from 115, we get 26, which is also not 48.
- If we subtract 78 from 89, we get 11. Now, if we add 37 to 11, we get 48.
So the equation would be 89 - 78 + 37 = 48.
</think>
<answer> 89 - 78 + 37 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 27, 4, and 48. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to equal 71.
We can try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
(27 + 48) = 75 (close but too high)
(48 - 27) = 21 (too low)
27 + 4 + 48 = 79 (too high)
27 + 48 - 4 = 71 (this looks promising)
4 + 27 + 48 = 79 (too high)
Among these, the combination 27 + 48 - 4 gives us 71 exactly, using each number only once.
</think>
<answer> 27 + 48 - 4 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 27, 4, and 48. We need to form an equation that equals 71 using each number exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by looking at the three numbers:
- 27 is relatively large, so subtracting or dividing by it early might skew our result.
- 4 is a small number, so adding or multiplying by it could help balance the equation.
- 48 is also large and could be used in combination with 4 to get close to 71.
Let's try combining 48 and 4:
48 + 4 = 52
Now we need to get from 52 to 71:
71 - 52 = 19
But we can't use 19 with the remaining number 27 in a simple operation without repeating numbers.
Let's try another combination:
48 - 27 = 21
Now we need 71 - 21:
71 - 21 = 50
This works, but we need to use all the numbers once and we didn't use 4 yet.
Let's try:
27 + 48 = 75 - 4 = 71
Here we used 27 + 48 = 75 and then subtracted 4 to get 71, thus using each number exactly once.
</think>
<answer> 27 + 48 - 4 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 27, 4, and 48. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 71.
- Adding 27 and 48 gives us 75.
- Subtracting 4 from 75 gives us 71.
So, the equation can be 27 + 48 - 4 = 71.
Since we are allowed to use each number only once and this equation satisfies the requirement, we can conclude that the equation is correct.
</think>
<answer> 27 + 48 - 4 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 27, 4, and 48. We need to create an equation that equals 71 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
We can try different combinations:
- 27 + 4 + 48 = 79 (which is close but too high)
- 48 + 4 + 27 = 79 (again too high)
- 48 + (27 - 4) = 69 (a bit less than 71)
- (48 - 27) + 4 = 21 + 4 = 25 (much too low)
- 27 + (48 - 4) = 27 + 44 = 71 (this works)
So, the correct equation is 27 + (48 - 4) = 71.
</think>
<answer> 27 + (48 - 4) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 22, 8, and 76. We need to form an equation using these numbers with the basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) only once each such that the result is 46.
One way to approach this is to try different combinations of operations.
Let's try: 76 - 22 - 8
76 - 22 = 54
54 - 8 = 46
This combination works. So, the equation is 76 - 22 - 8 = 46.
</think>
<answer> 76 - 22 - 8 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we have the numbers 51, 94, and 57 to use in an equation that equals 14. Since we can only use each number once, let's examine the possibilities with basic arithmetic operations.
One approach is to consider the operations between pairs of numbers:
- 51 - 94 = -43 (not 14)
- 94 - 51 = 43 (not 14)
- 57 - 94 = -37 (not 14)
- 51 - 57 = -6 (not 14)
- 94 - 57 = 37 (not 14)
- 57 - 51 = 6 (not 14)
None of these straightforward combinations work. Let's try a more complex combination:
Considering the combinations of addition and subtraction:
51 + 94 + 57 = 152 (too high)
The numbers can't be simply added together as they exceed 14.
Let's check if we can combine subtraction:
94 - 51 - 57 = -14 (this works)
However, we need the positive 14, not -14.
Now, let's think of the multiplication and division possibilities:
57 * 51 / 94 = 332. 1, and this doesn't get us to 14 - too large.
57 / 94 * 51 = 33. 592 - not 14.
Since the straightforward combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division do not yield 14, we need to reassess. The correct way turns out to be:
57 - 94 + 51 = 14.
We can check this calculation:
57 - 94 + 51 = 14.
57 - 94 = -37
-37 + 51 = 14.
Thus, the correct equation using the given numbers is:
(57 - 94) + 51 = 14.
</think>
<answer>(57 - 94) + 51</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 12, 3, and 26. We need to create an equation using each number exactly once that equals 35.
- We can start by adding or subtracting these numbers: 12 + 3 + 26 = 41, which is too high.
- Let's try another combination: 26 + 3 - 12 = 17, which is too low.
- Now, let's try a different combination: 26 + 12 - 3 = 35. This looks promising as it uses each number exactly once.
So, the equation 26 + 12 - 3 equals 35.
</think>
<answer> 26 + 12 - 3 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 12, 3, and 26. We need to create an equation that equals 35 using each number exactly once.
We can start by adding the first two numbers: 12 + 3 = 15.
Next, we need 20 more to reach 35. We have the number 26, and if we subtract 6 from 26, we get 20: 26 - 3 = 23, but this isn't the case we need.
Then we consider multiplication or division. If we take 12 * 3 = 36, this is close but still more than 35. If we try 12 / 3 = 4, which is less than what we need.
Then it would be 26 + 12 / 3. This means we divide 12 by 3 first: 12 / 3 = 4, and then add 26 to this result: 26 + 4 = 30. This is still not 35.
Next, 12 + (26 - 3) might work to get 35. If we calculate it step by step: 26 - 3 = 23, then 12 + 23 = 35.
So the equation would be 12 + (26 - 3) = 35.
</think>
<answer> 12 + (26 - 3) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 67, 19, and 30. We need to create an equation using these numbers only once that equals 78.
- We can start by looking at the possible combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Adding or subtracting these numbers directly doesn't seem to work, so let's try multiplication and division.
- If we multiply 67 by 30, we get 1980, which is too large.
- If we divide 67 by 30, we get approximately 2. 233, which is not helpful for reaching 78.
- If we divide 30 by 19, we get approximately 1. 579, also not useful.
- Now let's consider 67 - 30 = 37, and then see if we can get to 78 with the remaining number 19.
- Adding 37 and 19 gives us 56, which is not 78.
- Let's consider another combination: 67 + 19 = 86, and then subtract 30 from 86, which gives us 56.
- Now, let's try 67 - 19 = 48, and then add 30 to get 78.
This last combination 67 - 19 + 30 = 78 works.
</think>
<answer> 67 - 19 + 30 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 67, 19, and 30. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once that equals 78.
Let's try different combinations:
- 67 + 19 + 30 = 116 (which is too high)
- 67 + 19 - 30 = 56 (which is too low)
- 67 + 30 - 19 = 80 (which is too high)
- 67 - 19 + 30 = 78 (which is our target)
So, the equation that works is 67 - 19 + 30 = 78.
</think>
<answer> 67 - 19 + 30 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 77, 52, and 7. We need to create an equation that equals 41 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try different combinations:
1. 77 - 52 + 7 = 32 + 7 = 39 (not 41)
2. 77 + 52 - 7 = 129 - 7 = 122 (too high)
3. 52 + 77 - 7 = 69 + 77 = 146 (too high)
4. 77 + (52 - 7) = 77 + 45 = 122 (too high)
5. (77 - 7) + 52 = 70 + 52 = 122 (too high)
6. 77 + 52 / 7 = 77 + 7. 42857 (not an integer)
7. 7 + 52 + 77 = 66 + 77 = 143 (too high)
8. 52 + 77 / 7 = 52 + 11 = 63 (too high)
9. 77 - 52 - 7 = 25 - 7 = 18 (too low)
10. 52 + 77 - 7 = 69 + 77 = 146 (too high)
11. 7 + 52 + 77 = 66 + 77 = 143 (too high)
12. 77 / (52 - 7) = 77 / 45 = 1. 71111 (not an integer)
13. 77 / (52 + 7) = 77 / 59 = 1. 30508 (not an integer)
14. (77 - 52) + 7 = 25 + 7 = 32 (too low)
15. (77 + 52) - 7 = 129 - 7 = 122 (too high)
16. 52 - (77 - 7) = 52 - 70 = -18 (too low)
17. 77 / 7 + 52 = 11 + 52 = 63 (too high)
18. 52 - 77 + 7 = -25 + 7 = -18 (too low)
It seems none of these simple combinations work, but let’s now try nested operations:
52 - (77 / 7) = 52 - 11 = 41
This works, as 52 - (77 / 7) = 52 - 11 = 41.
</think>
<answer> 52 - (77 / 7) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 11, 22, 15, and 2. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 16.
One way to approach this is to try combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Let's try a combination: 22 - 15 - 11 + 2
22 - 15 = 7
7 - 11 = -4
-4 + 2 = -2
This doesn't work. Let's try another combination: 22 - 15 + 11 + 2
22 - 15 = 7
7 + 11 = 18
18 + 2 = 20
This also doesn't work. Let's try: 22 + 15 - 11 - 2
22 + 15 = 37
37 - 11 = 26
26 - 2 = 24
This is still not correct. Let's try: 22 + 15 + 11 - 22
22 + 15 = 37
37 + 11 = 48
48 - 22 = 26
This is not correct either. Let's try: 22 + 15 - 11 + 2
22 + 15 = 37
37 - 11 = 26
26 + 2 = 28
This is not correct. Let's try: 22 + 11 - 15 + 2
22 + 11 = 33
33 - 15 = 18
18 + 2 = 20
Still not correct. Let's try: 11 + 22 - 15 + 2
11 + 22 = 33
33 - 15 = 18
18 + 2 = 20
This is still not correct. Let's try 11 + 22 + 15 - 22
11 + 22 = 33
33 + 15 = 48
48 - 22 = 26
This is not correct. Let's try 11 + 2 + 22 - 15
11 + 2 = 13
13 + 22 = 35
35 - 15 = 20
This is still not correct. Let's try: 11 + 22 - 15 - 2
11 + 22 = 33
33 - 15 = 18
18 - 2 = 16
This gives us the correct result of 16.

<answer> 11 + 22 - 15 - 2 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 22, 86, and 3. We need to use each number exactly once and combine them using basic arithmetic operations to get the result of 61.
- Adding the numbers: 22 + 86 + 3 = 111 (This is too high)
- Subtracting the smallest from the sum of the other two: 86 + 3 - 22 = 67 (This is also too high)
- Another combination: 86 - 22 + 3 = 67 (This is still too high)
- Let's try a different combination: (86 - 22) + 3 = 67 (Again, too high)
- Now let's try: 86 - (22 + 3) = 86 - 25 = 61 (This gives us 61)
So, the equation that uses the numbers 22, 86, and 3 exactly once to get 61 is 86 - (22 + 3) </think>
<answer> 86 - (22 + 3) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 48, 1, 51, and 15. We need to create an equation that equals 12 using each number exactly once.
One way to approach this is to think about combinations of operations that can reduce the numbers in a helpful way.
Let's try subtraction:
- If we subtract 15 from 51, we get 36.
- Then if we subtract 48 from 36, we get -12.
- Finally, we need to make this equal 12, which seems far from our goal.
Let's try another combination:
- Subtracting 15 from 48 gives 33.
- Subtracting 1 from 33 gives 32.
- Now we need to get to 12, and these numbers don't seem to help.
Let's try a different operation: multiplication and addition from smaller numbers.
- Multiply 1 by 15 to get 15.
- Add this to 48 to get 63.
- We need to reduce this further to get to 12.
- Subtracting 51 from 63 gives 12.
Thus, we can use the equation: 48 - 51 + 1 * 15 = 12.
</think>
<answer> 48 - 51 + 1 * 15 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 56, 61, and 41. We need to use each number exactly once to get a result of 46 using basic arithmetic operations.
- Let's try combining operations and different numbers. We can start by subtracting the smaller number from the larger ones to see if we can get close to 46.
- 61 - 41 = 20
- Now we need to use 56 and get to 26 (since 20 + 26 = 46).
- We can try 56 - 20 = 36, which is not 26, so this isn't working.
- Let's try another combination: 61 - 56 = 5, then we need 41 - 5 to make 36, but this doesn't work as 41 - 5 = 36, and we don't have the 20 anymore.
- Let's try a different approach: 61 + 41 = 102, then we need to subtract 56 from 102 to get 46 (102 - 56 = 46).
- This works, but we haven't used all numbers yet. So, let's see if we can substitute one of them, for example, using 56 + (61 - 41).
- 56 + (61 - 41) = 56 + 20 = 76, which is too large.
- Now, let's check the correct sequence: (61 + 41) - 56 = 102 - 56 = 46.
So, the correct equation is (61 + 41) - 56.
</think>
<answer>(61 + 41) - 56</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 1, 11, and 14. We need to create an equation that equals 24 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
One way to approach this is by trying different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Let's try: 14 - 11 + 1
14 - 11 = 3
3 + 1 = 4
This doesn't work.
Let's try another combination: 14 - (11 - 1)
14 - 11 = 3
3 + 1 = 4
This also doesn't work.
Now let's try: (14 - 11) * 1
(14 - 11) = 3
3 * 1 = 3
This doesn't work either.
Let's try a different order: 14 + (11 - 1)
14 + (11 - 1) = 14 + 10 = 24
This works! We have used each number exactly once and the equation equals 24.
</think>
<answer> 14 + (11 - 1) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 75, 1, and 3. We need to create an equation that equals 79 using these numbers exactly once.
We can start by looking at the structure we need:
79 = 75 + X + 1 - something (since we have 1 and 3 left)
Let's try adding and subtracting the available numbers:
75 + 1 = 76
If we add 3 to 76, we get:
76 + 3 = 79
So the equation using the numbers 75, 1, and 3, with the operations of addition and inclusion of 3, results in:
75 + 1 + 3
However, this doesn't use the third number in the expected operation - subtraction. Let's try another combination:
75 + 1 + 3 - 3
Here, we use 3 in such a way that it cancels out:
75 + 1 + 3 - 3 = 75 + 1 = 76
We are still short 3. Let's try another approach:
75 + 1 + (79 - 75 - 1)
This gets:
75 + 1 + 3 = 79
This is correct and uses all numbers.
Therefore, the equation is: 75 + 1 + 3
</think>
<answer> 75 + 1 + 3 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's evaluate the given numbers: 75, 1, and 3. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 79.
We can start by adding or subtracting these numbers, and then see if we can adjust with multiplication or division to reach 79.
- 75 + 1 + 3 = 79
This equation uses all the numbers exactly once and equals 79.
</think>
<answer> 75 + 1 + 3 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 79, 31, 7, and 80. We need to create an equation that equals 39 using each number exactly once.
One approach is to try different combinations of operations. Let's try multiplication and addition/subtraction:
79 * 31 = 2449 (too large)
80 * 31 = 2480 (too large)
79 * 7 = 553 (too large)
31 * 7 = 217 (too large)
79 + 31 + 7 = 117 (too large)
79 + 31 - 80 = 29 (too small)
Now let's try a different combination:
(80 - 31) + 79 = 69 (too large)
(80 - 79) + 31 = 2 (too small)
(80 - 31) + 7 = 56 (too large)
(31 - 7) + 79 = 93 (too large)
(80 - 79) + 31 = 12 (too small)
After these combinations, we see that 31, 79, and 7, when used in combination, form:
(80 - (79 - 31)) = 80 - 48 = 32 (still not 39)
Finally, trying:
(79 - 31) + 80 - 7 = 48 + 80 - 7 = 121 - 7 = 114 (too large)
We'll try:
(80 + 31) - 79 - 7 = 111 - 79 - 7 = 32 - 79 (still not getting close
We move to:
79 - 31 + 80 - 7 = 48 + 73 = 121 - 7 (still not small 39)
After breaking more, we have:
(80 + 31) - 79 + 7 = 111 - 79 + 7 = 39
Final equation condensing:
(80 + 31 - 79) + 7 = 39
Final calculation:
(80 + 31 - 79) + 7 = 39
</think>
<answer> (80 + 31 - 79) + 7 </answer>

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 48, 96, and 90. We need to create an equation using these numbers only once that equals 54.

- Let's try a combination: 96 - 48 - 90. But this doesn't work since it equals -42.
- Next, let's try 96 - 48 + 90. This equals 148, which is too high.
- Now, let's try 96 + 48 - 90. This simplifies to 94 - 90 = 4. This is not 54.
- Another approach is to try 96 + 48 / 90. This doesn't work as well because 48 / 90 is less than 1 and adding 96 doesn't help us reach 54.
- Now, let's try 96 - (90 - 48). This simplifies to 96 - 42 = 54. This works!
So, the equation is 96 - (90 - 48) = 54.

<answer> 96 - (90 - 48) </answer>

<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 3, 83, 2, and 68. We need to create an equation that equals 20 using each number exactly once with the allowed operations being addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
One way to approach this is to look for combinations of these numbers that could potentially sum up or subtract to reach 20.
83 - 68 - 3 + 2 could be a possibility. Let's see the math:
83 - 68 = 15
15 - 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14
It looks like we're not quite there. Let's try another combination: 83 - 68 + 3 - 2
83 - 68 = 15
15 + 3 = 18
18 - 2 = 16
This is still not 20. Let's try a different permutation: 83 + 2 - 68 - 3
83 + 2 = 85
85 - 68 = 17
17 - 3 = 14
It's becoming clear that we need to use different operations or consider a different structure. Let's try 83 + 2 - 68 + 3
83 + 2 = 85
85 - 68 = 17
17 + 3 = 20
This combination works because it uses all the numbers exactly once and applies the operations to reach 20.
</think>
<answer> 83 + 2 - 68 + 3 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 23, 1, and 70. We need to create an equation that equals 93 using each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
- Let's try different combinations:
  - 70 + 23 + 1 = 94 (this is too high)
  - 70 + 23 - 1 = 92 (this is close, but not 93)
  - 70 + 1 - 23 = 48 (too low)
  - 70 - 23 + 1 = 48 (too low)
  - 23 + 70 + 1 = 94 (too high)
  - 23 - 1 + 70 = 92 (too low)
  - 1 + 23 + 70 = 94 (too high)
  - 1 + 70 - 23 = 48 (too low)
  - 23 - 70 + 1 = -46 (too low)
  - 1 * 23 + 70 = 93 (this works)
  - 23 * 1 + 70 = 93 (this also works)
After checking all combinations, both 1 * 23 + 70 and 23 * 1 + 70 work, giving the desired result of 93.
</think>
<answer> 1 * 23 + 70 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 37, 84, and 40. We need to create an equation that equals 81 using these numbers exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
- Adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing these numbers in various combinations doesn't immediately yield 81.
- Let's try a different approach by looking for a combination that might fit. 
- Suppose we use 84 - 37 and then add 40:
  84 - 37 = 47
  Now we need 34 more to reach 81. 
  - 47 + 34 would be 81, but we cannot form 34 with the given numbers.
- Let's try another arrangement:
  84 - 40 = 44
  Now we need 37 more to reach 81.
  - 44 + 37 would be 81, but we need to use all three numbers.
- However, if we use the reverse of the arrangement:
  37 + 40 = 77
  Now we need 3 more to reach 81.
  - 77 + 3 = 80, which is not 81.
- Finally, let's try:
  84 + 40 - 37 = 87 - 37 = 50, which doesn't help.
- We notice a pattern but need to combine so that 84 - 40 + 37 fits:
  Correct arrangement - noticing we must match 81, let's use:
  (84 - 40) + 37 = 44 + 37 = 81.
This fits our requirement.
</think>
<answer> (84 - 40) + 37 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 11, 20, and 62. We need to create an equation that equals 53 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try different combinations:
- 11 + 20 + 62 = 93 (This doesn't work)
- 62 + 20 - 11 = 71 (This doesn't work)
- 62 - 20 + 11 = 53 (This works)
So, the equation that uses the numbers 11, 20, and 62 in such a way that it equals 53 is 62 - 20 + 11.
</think>
<answer> 62 - 20 + 11 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 28, 4, and 15. We need to create an equation that equals 47 using each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by looking at the target number (47) and the numbers we have. One strategy is to see if combining numbers in different ways using addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division can get us close to 47.
Let's try combining 28 and 15 first:
28 + 15 = 43 (which is close to 47, but a bit short)
We need 4 more to reach 47. The remaining number is 4, and 4 * 1 = 4. This works perfectly!
So our equation is: 28 + 15 + 4 = 47.
</think>
<answer> 28 + 15 + 4 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 25, 26, and 28 that equals 29. Let's examine the numbers and possible operations:
- One approach could be to check if any straightforward operation between these numbers directly gives 29.
- We can consider addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Let's try the numbers: 26 + 28 = 54 (too high)
- Then, 28 - 26 = 2 (too low)
- Next, let's try 28 + 25 = 53 (still too high)
- 26 + 25 = 51 (too high)
- 26 - 25 = 1 (too low)
- We haven't used 28 directly in other combinations yet.
- Now let's try multiplication and subtraction or addition:
  - 28 * 25 / 10 - 26 = 70 - 26 = 44 (not 29)
  - Trying division: 28 / 25 + 26 = 1.12 + 26 = 27.12 (not 29)
  - Another try: 28 - 26 + 25 = 7 + 25 = 32 (too high)
  - We need to re-examine the possible single operations.
  - Let's use all: 28 + 26 - 25 = 54 - 25 = 29
This equation uses all numbers exactly once and satisfies the condition.
</think>
<answer> 28 + 26 - 25 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 94, 9, and 8. We need to create an equation that equals 93 using each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by looking at possible combinations:
- 94 - 9 - 8 = 87 (This is too high)
- 94 - 9 + 8 = 93 (This is exactly what we need)
- 94 + 9 - 8 = 95 (This is too high)
- 94 + 9 + 8 = 111 (This is much too high)
From these combinations, we can see that 94 - 9 + 8 = 93 works perfectly.
</think>
<answer> 94 - 9 + 8 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 4, 94, and 23. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 75.
We can try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
- 94 - 4 - 23 = 67 (doesn't equal 75)
- 94 - 4 + 23 = 113 (doesn't equal 75)
- 94 + 4 - 23 = 75 (this equals 75)
So, the equation 94 + 4 - 23 equals 75.
</think>
<answer> 94 + 4 - 23 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 73, 8, and 76. We need to use each number exactly once to make the equation equal to 11.
Let's try different combinations:
- 73 - 8 - 76 = -11 (not 11)
- 73 - 8 + 76 = 141 (not 11)
- 73 + 8 - 76 = 5 (not 11)
- 8 + 76 - 73 = 11 (this equals 11)
So, we found a combination that works: 8 + 76 - 73 = 11.
</think>
<answer> 8 + 76 - 73 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to create an equation using the numbers 88, 1, and 20 that equals 67. We should consider different combinations of these numbers using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- 88 + 1 + 20 = 109 (This is too high)
- 88 + 1 - 20 = 70 (This is also too high)
- 88 + 20 - 1 = 107 (This is quite high as well)
- 88 - 1 - 20 = 67 (This seems promising)
- 88 - 20 + 1 = 70 (This doesn't work)
- 1 + 20 + 88 = 109 (This is too high)
- 1 - 20 + 88 = 70 (This isn't correct)
From the above calculations, we can see that 88 - 1 - 20 = 67 works.
</think>
<answer> 88 - 1 - 20 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 51, 98, and 73. We need to create an equation using these numbers only once each that equals 76.
Let's try different combinations:
1. 98 - 51 + 73 = 116 (this is too high)
2. 98 + 51 - 73 = 76 (this is exactly what we need)
3. 51 + 98 - 73 = 76 (let's check this as well)
4. 98 - 73 + 51 = 76 (let's check this as well)
Both 51 + 98 - 73 and 98 - 73 + 51 equal 76. However, we should use the first combination that we find, as it matches our initial approach.
So the valid equation is 51 + 98 - 73 = 76.
</think>
<answer> 51 + 98 - 73 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 11, 32, and 28. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once, with the operations +, -, *, and /, that equals 15.
One approach is to try different combinations:
- 32 - 11 - 28 = -15 (This is not correct as we need 15, not -15)
- 32 - 11 + 28 = 49 (Not 15)
- 32 + 11 - 28 = 15 (This seems promising)
- 32 + 28 - 11 = 49 (Not 15)
- 11 + 32 - 28 = 15 (This is correct)
So, the correct equation is using the numbers 32, 11, and 28 such that 32 + 11 - 28 = 15.
</think>
<answer> 32 + 11 - 28 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 11, 32, and 28. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 15.
Let's try different combinations:
- 32 - 11 - 28 = -15 (not equal to 15)
- 32 - 11 + 28 = 49 (not equal to 15)
- 32 + 11 - 28 = 15 (this equals 15)
So we have found that 32 + 11 - 28 equals 15.
</think>
<answer> 32 + 11 - 28 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider all possible combinations of the numbers 73, 12, 48, and 46 using the basic arithmetic operations to see if we can get to 87.
- 73 + 12 + 48 + 46 = 179 (This is too high)
- 73 + 12 + 48 - 46 = 87 (This seems promising)
- 73 + 12 - 48 + 46 = 83 (This is close but not quite 87)
- 73 - 12 + 48 - 46 = 63 (This is too low)
- 73 - 12 + 48 + 46 = 175 (This is too high)
- 73 - 12 - 48 + 46 = 69 (This is too low)
From these combinations, we see that 73 + 12 + 48 - 46 equals 87.
</think>
<answer> 73 + 12 + 48 - 46 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 55, 80, and 36. We need to create an equation that equals 99 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
One approach is to try combining the numbers in different ways with addition and subtraction.
55 + 80 = 135
135 - 36 = 102
This doesn't give us 99. Let's try another combination:
80 + 36 = 116
116 - 55 = 61
This also doesn't work. Let's try multiplication and addition:
55 * 36 = 1980
This is way too high, so let's try:
80 * 36 = 2880
This is also incorrect. Now, let's try:
80 + 55 = 135
135 + 36 = 171
This is still not 99. We need to think about the subtractive and additive combinations:
55 + 80 = 135, and then 135 - 36 = 99.
This combination gives us the correct result of 99.
So the equation is: 55 + 80 - 36 = 99.
</think>
<answer> 55 + 80 - 36 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 55, 80, and 36. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 99.
One way to approach this is to try different combinations of operations.
Let's try: 80 - 55 + 36
80 - 55 = 25
25 + 36 = 61
This doesn't give us 99.
Let's try another one: 80 + 55 - 36
80 + 55 = 135
135 - 36 = 99
This gives us the result we want.
So, the equation is 80 + 55 - 36 = 99.
</think>
<answer> 80 + 55 - 36 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider all possible combinations using the numbers 74, 8, 37, and 57 with the basic arithmetic operations. We need to form an equation that equals 62.
- Adding and subtracting: 74 + 8 + 37 + 57 = 176 (too high)
- 74 + 8 + 37 - 57 = 62 (this looks promising)
- Other combinations of two numbers give results that are not 62.
So, 74 + 8 + 37 - 57 equals 62.
</think>
<answer> 74 + 8 + 37 - 57 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 39, 42, and 15. We need to create an equation that uses each number exactly once and results in 96.
One way to approach this is to look at the operations we can perform and how we might combine the numbers to reach the target.
Let's try combining 42 and 15:
42 + 15 = 57
Now we need an operation to get from 57 to 96. Let's try:
96 - 57 = 39
Thus, we can combine these operations using the numbers 39, 42, and 15:
(42 + 15) + 39 = 96
</think>
<answer> (42 + 15) + 39 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 6, 41, and 19. We need to create an equation that equals 66 using each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
One way to approach this is to consider the sum of the numbers and then adjust for the target of 66:
6 + 41 + 19 = 66
This equation uses all the numbers and the sum is 66, which is our target. So we have a valid equation.
</think>
<answer> 6 + 41 + 19 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 77, 51, and 52. We need to create an equation that equals 26 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
One way to approach this is to try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Let's try: 77 - 51 + 52
77 - 51 = 26
26 + 52 = 78 (This doesn't work as we are only allowed to use the numbers once and get 26)

Let's try: 77 + 51 - 52
77 + 51 = 128
128 - 52 = 76 (This doesn't work either)

Let's try: 52 + 51 - 77
52 + 51 = 103
103 - 77 = 26 (This works as it uses all numbers exactly once and equals 26)

So, the equation that works is: 52 + 51 - 77
</think>
<answer> 52 + 51 - 77 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 30, 32, and 20. We need to use each of these numbers exactly once to make an equation that equals 82.
- One way to approach this is to try combining these numbers using different arithmetic operations.
- Let's try adding 32 and 20 first: 32 + 20 = 52. Now we need 30 more to reach 82.
- We can get 30 from 32 - 2, but then we would be repeating numbers which is not allowed.
- Next, let's try another combination: (32 - 30) * 20 + 32. This simplifies to 2 * 20 + 32, which equals 40 + 32 = 72.
- That doesn't work, so let's try: 32 + (30 * 2). This gives us 32 + 60 = 92, which is too high.
- Finally, let's try: 32 + 30 + 20. This sums up to 82, but we can only use each number once.
- So, another better combination would be: 32 + 20 + 30. However, since we had 32 and 20 used, a possible also correct form could be derived by reordering but keeping each unique.
- Rechecking: 32 + 20 + 30 makes sense, therefore, the solution in the format required is: 32 + 20 + 30.
</think>
<answer> 32 + 20 + 30 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 42, 55, and 86. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once to get 99 as the result.
Let's try different combinations:
- 86 - 42 - 55 = 9
- 86 + 55 - 42 = 101
- 86 - 55 + 42 = 73
- 86 + 42 - 55 = 73
- 55 + 42 + 86 = 183
None of the above combinations result in 99. Let's try another approach by reordering and adding/subtracting differently:
- 86 + 55 + 42 = 183
This also doesn't work. It seems I'm missing a multiplication or division step. Let's include multiplication and division in the mix:
- (86 * 55 / 42) = 110.95, which is not 99
- (86 * 42 / 55) = 69.89, which is not 99
- (86 / 42 * 55) = 111.04, which is not 99
Now let's consider rearranging the operations:
- (86 + 55) - 42 = 99
This works! Therefore, the equation is 86 + 55 - 42 = 99.
</think>
<answer> (86 + 55) - 42 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to create an equation using the numbers 4, 72, and 30 that equals 48. Let's consider different combinations of these numbers and the operations we can use.
1. 72 - 30 - 4 = 38 (This is not 48)
2. 72 - 30 + 4 = 46 (This is not 48)
3. 72 + 30 - 4 = 102 - 4 = 98 (This is not 48)
4. 72 + 30 + 4 = 106 (This is not 48)
5. 30 + 72 - 4 = 102 - 4 = 98 (This is not 48)
6. 30 + 72 + 4 = 102 + 4 = 106 (This is not 48)
7. 30 - 72 + 4 = -42 + 4 = -38 (This is not 48)
8. 30 * 4 / 72 = 120 / 72 = 1. 666... (This is not 48)
9. 30 * 72 / 4 = 2160 / 4 = 540 (This is not 48)
10. 4 * 72 / 30 = 288 / 30 = 9. 6 (This is not 48)
11. 4 * 30 / 72 = 120 / 72 = 1. 666... (This is not 48)
12. 4 * (72 / 30) = 4 * 2. 4 = 9. 6 (This is not 48)
13. 72 / 30 + 4 = 2. 4 + 4 = 6. 4 (This is not 48)
14. 72 / (30 - 4) = 72 / 26 = 2. 769... (This is not 48)
15. (72 / 4) + 30 = 18 + 30 = 48 (This is 48)
So, the equation that equals 48 using the numbers 4, 72, and 30 is 72 / 4 + 30.
</think>
<answer> (72 / 4) + 30 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to create an equation that equals 42 using the numbers 49, 45, and 46 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by checking different combinations:
- \( 49 - 45 + 46 \) gives us \( 4 + 46 = 50 \), which is not 42.
- \( 49 + 45 - 46 \) gives us \( 94 - 46 = 48 \), which is not 42.
- \( 49 + (45 - 46) \) gives us \( 49 + 1 = 50 \), which is not 42.
- \( 45 + 46 - 49 \) gives us \( 91 - 49 = 42 \), which is correct.
So, we get an equation: \( 45 + 46 - 49 = 42 \).

<answer> 45 + 46 - 49 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 23, 7, and 83. We need to create an equation that equals 67 using each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
- One way to approach this is to try different combinations of the operations.
- Let's try: 83 - 23 - 7
  - Calculate this: 83 - 23 = 60
  - Then, 60 - 7 = 53
  - This doesn't give us 67.
- Next, let's try: 83 - 23 + 7
  - Calculate this: 83 - 23 = 60
  - Then, 60 + 7 = 67
  - This gives us the desired result of 67.
Therefore, the equation is 83 - 23 + 7 = 67.

<answer> 83 - 23 + 7 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 36, 99, and 28. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once that equals 91.
We can try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
- 99 + 36 + 28 = 163 (This is too high)
- 99 + 36 - 28 = 107 (This is also too high)
- 99 + 28 - 36 = 91 (This is what we're looking for)
- 99 - 36 + 28 = 91 (Another valid combination)
- 36 + 99 - 28 = 107 (This is too high)
From these combinations, we see that both 99 + 28 - 36 and 99 - 36 + 28 equal 91.
</think>
<answer> 99 + 28 - 36 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 36, 99, and 28. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations, to get 91.
We can start by looking at the operations we can perform:
- Addition: 36 + 99 + 28 = 163 (This is too high)
- Subtraction: 99 - 36 - 28 = 35 (This is too low)
- Multiplication: 36 * 28 = 1008 (This is much too high)
- Division: 99 / 36 (approximately 2.75) and other combinations don't seem to work easily.
Now, let's try another approach by exploring combinations:
99 - 36 + 28 = 91. This combination gives us 99 - 36 = 63, and then 63 + 28 = 91, which equals 91.
</think>
<answer> 99 - 36 + 28 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 2, 39, and 15. We need to form an equation using each number exactly once to get the result 56.
Let's try different combinations:
- Using 39 as it is and combining 2 and 15: 39 + 2 + 15 = 56 (This works!)
- Checking other combinations: 2 + 39 + 15 = 56, 15 + 39 + 2 = 56, 2 * 39 + 15 = 93 (not 56), 15 * 39 + 2 = 607 (not 56), etc.
So, we have found that 39 + 2 + 15 equals 56.
</think>
<answer> 39 + 2 + 15 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 33, 5, and 17. We need to create an equation using these numbers only once each to equal 21.
We can try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Let's try:
33 - 17 = 16
16 + 5 = 21
This combination works. Therefore, our equation is 33 - 17 + 5 = 21.
</think>
<answer> 33 - 17 + 5 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 8, 49, 50, and 65. We need to combine these using basic arithmetic operations to get 58.
- Adding and subtracting 8, 49, and 50 doesn't seem to get us close to 58.
- Let's try combining some of these numbers using multiplication and addition/subtraction:
  - 8 + 49 + 50 - 65 = 97 - 65 = 32 (too high)
  - 8 + 49 - 50 + 65 = 17 - 50 + 65 = -33 + 65 = 32 (still too high)
  - 8 + 49 + 65 - 50 = 117 - 50 = 67 (too high)
  - 49 + 50 - 8 - 65 = 99 - 14 = 85 (too high)
  - 50 + 65 - 49 - 8 = 115 - 57 = 58 (this works! )
So, the correct combination is 50 + 65 - 49 - 8.
</think>
<answer> 50 + 65 - 49 - 8 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's evaluate the given numbers: 80, 73, and 78. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 85.
We can try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Consider: 80 - 73 + 78
This gives us: 80 - 73 = 7, and then 7 + 78 = 85
So the equation that works is: 80 - 73 + 78 = 85.
</think>
<answer> 80 - 73 + 78 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 80, 73, and 78. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get a result of 85.
- Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- One possible combination is: (80 - 73) + 78
  - Start with 80 - 73 = 7
  - Then add 78 to 7: 7 + 78 = 85
So, the equation is (80 - 73) + 78 = 85.
</think>
<answer> (80 - 73) + 78 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to create an equation using the numbers 73, 1, and 90 that equals 18. Let's consider the operations we can use: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
- If we add 73 and 1, we get 74, which is too high to reach 18 with any further operations using 90.
- If we subtract 1 from 73, we get 72, still too high.
- If we subtract 90 from 73, we get -17, which is not helpful.
- If we multiply 73 by 1, we get 73, still not reaching 18.
- If we divide 73 by 1, we get 73, not helpful.
- If we add 1 and 90, we get 91, not useful.
- If we divide 90 by 1, we get 90, which is not useful.
- Now let's consider combinations: 90 - 73 - 1 gives 16, which is close but not 18.
- If we look again, 90 - 73 + 1 gives 18, which is exactly what we want.
So the equation is 90 - 73 + 1 = 18.
</think>
<answer> 90 - 73 + 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 18, 77, and 51. We need to create an equation that equals 44 using each number exactly once and only basic arithmetic operations.
We can start with the operations we might try:
- Adding and subtracting: (18 + 77) - 51 = 95 - 51 = 44
- Subtracting and adding: 77 - 51 + 18 = 26 + 18 = 44
- Multiplying and adding/subtracting: We can't easily combine these to get 44, as we would either get too large a number or a mix of results.
- Combining division and addition/subtraction: (77 / 18) + 51 does not equal 44
Thus, the expression (18 + 77) - 51 equals 44, using each number only once.
</think>
<answer>(18 + 77) - 51</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 55, 20, and 12. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 23.
We can try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
- 55 - 20 - 12 = 23 (This works because 55 minus 20 gives 35, and 35 minus 12 gives 23)
- Other combinations like division or combining different operations do not yield 23 without using the numbers more than once or not getting the result of 23.
So, the equation that correctly uses each number exactly once to get 23 is 55 - 20 - 12.
</think>
<answer> 55 - 20 - 12 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 55, 20, and 12. We need to create an equation that equals 23 using each number exactly once and basic arithmetic operations.
- Let's try different combinations:
  - \(55 - 20 - 12 = 23\) (This works because 55 minus 20 gives 35, and then subtracting 12 gives 23)
  - Other combinations like \(55 - 20 + 12\), \(55 + 20 - 12\), etc., do not result in 23.
Thus, the correct equation is \(55 - 20 - 12 = 23\).
</think>
<answer> 55 - 20 - 12 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 89, 17, and 71. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once, and the result should be 35.
One approach is to try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Let's try: 89 - 17 - 71
89 - 17 = 72
72 - 71 = 1
This doesn't give us 35.
Next, let's try: 89 - 17 + 71
89 - 17 = 72
72 + 71 = 143
This also doesn't give us 35.
Now, let's try: 89 + 17 - 71
89 + 17 = 106
106 - 71 = 35
This is the combination that works.
So, the equation is 89 + 17 - 71 = 35.
</think>
<answer> 89 + 17 - 71 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 85, 39, 61, and 25. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to equal 38.
We can start by trying different combinations of operations:
- 85 - 39 - 61 + 25 doesn't work because it equals 10
- 85 - 39 + 61 - 25 doesn't work because it equals 92
- 85 + 39 - 61 - 25 doesn't work because it equals 38, but we need to check if there's a different order that achieves the target.
- 61 + 39 - 85 - 25 doesn't work because it equals 10
- 85 - 61 + 39 - 25 does work because it equals 38
So, the equation that uses all numbers exactly once and equals 38 is: 85 - 61 + 39 - 25 </think>
<answer> 85 - 61 + 39 - 25 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to create an equation using the numbers 57, 42, and 35 exactly once to get the result of 64.
Let's try different combinations:
- 57 - 42 + 35 = 52 (too low)
- 57 + 42 - 35 = 64 (this looks promising)
- 57 + 35 - 42 = 50 (too low)
- 42 + 35 - 57 = 10 (too low)
- 42 - 57 + 35 = 20 (too low)
- 35 + 42 - 57 = 20 (too low)
The combination 57 + 42 - 35 results in 64.
</think>
<answer> 57 + 42 - 35 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 57, 42, and 35. We need to create an equation that uses these numbers exactly once and results in 64.
We can start by looking at combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- 57 + 42 + 35 does not equal 64 (specifically, it equals 134)
- 57 + 42 - 35 does not equal 64 (specifically, it equals 64)
So, the combination 57 + 42 - 35 does give us the desired result of 64.
</think>
<answer> 57 + 42 - 35 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 23, 49, and 9. We need to create an equation that equals 17 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try different combinations:
- 23 - 49 + 9 = -11 (too low)
- 23 + 49 - 9 = 63 (too high)
- 49 - 23 + 9 = 35 (too high)
- 49 + 23 - 9 = 63 (too high)
- 23 + 9 - 49 = -17 (too low)
- 9 + 23 - 49 = -17 (too low)
None of these combinations work. Let's try another approach:
- 49 - 23 = 26
Then we need 26 - 9 = 17 which is correct.
So, the equation is 49 - 23 - 9 = 17.
</think>
<answer> 49 - 23 - 9 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 28, 22, 60, and 2. We need to create an equation that equals 68 using each number exactly once.
Let's try different combinations:
- 28 + 22 + 60 + 2 = 112 (This is too high)
- 28 + 22 + 60 - 2 = 108 (This is also too high)
- 28 + 22 - 60 + 2 = 92 (Too high)
- 28 + 60 - 22 + 2 = 78 (Too high)
- 28 - 22 + 60 + 2 = 68 (This looks promising)
So, the equation 28 - 22 + 60 + 2 = 68 uses all the numbers exactly once and equals 68.
</think>
<answer> 28 - 22 + 60 + 2 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 28, 22, 60, and 2. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 68.
We can start by adding or subtracting these numbers to see if we get closer to 68.
- 28 + 22 = 50
- 50 + 60 = 110 (too high)
- 50 + 2 = 52 (still too low)
- 60 + 22 = 82 (too high)
- 60 + 2 = 62 (too low, and we used 2 already)
- 28 + 60 = 88 (too high)
- 28 + 2 = 30 (still too low)
Now let's try another combination:
- 60 + 22 + 2 = 84 (too high)
- 60 + 2 + 28 = 88 (too high)
- 28 + 22 + 2 = 52 (still too low)
We need to think about multiplication and division:
- 60 * 1. 1333 (28/22) is not an integer
- 28 * 22/2 = 28 * 11 = 308 (too high)
Let's check:
- 60 + 22 + 28 - 2 = 98 (too high)
If we look at it another way:
- 60 + 28 = 88 (too high)
- 60 + 22 + 2 = 84 (too high)
- 28 + 60 + 2 = 90 (too high)
Let's go back and try rearranging:
60 + 28 + 2 = 90 (too high)
Checking this again:
60 + 28 + 2 = 90 (too high)
So we are not getting result 68 with addition or simply with substitution.
Let us do:
(60 + 22) / 2 = 41
(41 + 28 - 22) = 47
We have to try other possibility:
60 + 22 + 28 +2 = 92 not 68
Reconsidering division:
2 * 28 = 56 then (60 + 22 + 2) - 56 = 38
So rechecking:
(60 + 22 - 28) + 2 = 56 +2 = 58;
But:
Solving this way:
(60 + 22 - 28) + 2 = 56 + 2 = 58
None seem work right, then final will be:
60 + 28 - 22 + 2
This seems as best is near 58
So final equations
We have to:
60 + 28 - 22 + 2 = 68
</think>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 25, 35, 2, and 71. We need to use each number exactly once to make the equation equal to 63.
- One way to approach this is to look for combinations of operations that might simplify the numbers.
- Let's try: (71 - 35 - 25) * 2
  - 71 - 35 = 36
  - 36 - 25 = 11
  - 11 * 2 = 22
  - This does not equal 63.
- Let's try another way: (71 - 25 - 35) * 2
  - 71 - 25 = 46
  - 46 - 35 = 11
  - 11 * 2 = 22
  - This also does not equal 63.
- Now let's try: (35 + 25 - 71) * 2
  - 35 + 25 = 60
  - 60 - 71 = -11
  - -11 * 2 = -22
  - This does not equal 63 either.
- Finally, let's try: (71 - 35) + (25 + 2)
  - 71 - 35 = 36
  - 25 + 2 = 27
  - 36 + 27 = 63
  - This equals 63.
</think>
<answer> (71 - 35) + (25 + 2) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 35, 91, and 74. We need to create an equation that equals 18 using each of these numbers exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
One approach is to try different combinations of operations:
- 91 - 35 - 74 = -17 (too small)
- 91 - 35 + 74 = 130 (too big)
- 91 + 35 - 74 = 52 (too big)
- 91 + 74 - 35 = 130 (too big)
- 35 + 91 - 74 = 52 (too big)
- 35 + 74 - 91 = 18 (this looks promising)
Therefore, the equation that uses all the numbers exactly once and equals 18 is 35 + 74 - 91.

- One approach is to check combinations of addition and subtraction.
- Let's try 51 + 21 + 40 = 112, which is too high.
- Now, let's try 51 + 21 - 49 - 40 = 51 + 21 - 89 = 72 - 89 = -17, which is too low.
- What if we rearrange the numbers? 51 + 49 + 21 - 40 = 100 + 21 - 40 = 121 - 40 = 81.
This combination gives us the desired result.

<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 48, 50, and 97. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 95.
One way to approach this is to try different combinations of operations.
If we add 48 and 50, we get 98, which is close to 95 but a bit too high.
If we subtract 48 from 97, we get 49, which is not 50.
If we subtract 50 from 97, we get 47, which is not 48.
Now, let's try multiplying and subtracting:
If we take 97 - 50 = 47, and then add 48, we get 47 + 48 = 95.
This works, so we have our equation.

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 80, 99, and 43. We need to create an equation using each of these numbers exactly once and the result should be 62.
We can try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Let's try: 99 - 80 + 43
99 - 80 = 19
19 + 43 = 62
So, the equation is 99 - 80 + 43 = 62.

<answer> 99 - 80 + 43 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to create an equation that equals 84 using the numbers 80, 27, 58, and 27 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
- If we look at the numbers, 80 + 27 + 58 + 27 should give us 192, which is too high.
- Let's try combinations like 80 + 27 + 58 - 27: This simplifies to 198 - 27 = 171, also too high.
- How about 80 + 58 + 27 - 27? This simplifies to 80 + 58 = 138, not 84.
- Now let's try 80 + 27 + 58 - 27: This is essentially 80 + 58 = 138 again.
- A new combination I'll try is (80 + 27) * 27 - 58: This evaluates to 107 * 27 - 58 = 2889 - 58 = 2831, which is not 84.
- Another way to approach this is (80 + 58) + 27 - 27: This simplifies to 138 + 27 - 27 = 138, not 84.
- Another valid approach: (80 + 27 - 27) + 58: This simplifies to 80 + 58 = 138, again not 84.
- A correct combination should be 80 + (27 - 27) + 58: This simplifies to 80 + 0 + 58 = 138, not 84.
- I'll check: (58 + 27) + 27 - 80: This simplifies as (85 + 27) - 80 = 112 - 80 = 32, not 84.
- The best approach now: (80 + 27) - (58 + 27): This simplifies to 107 - 85 = 22, not 84. 
- Now, 58 - 27 + (80 + 27) is 31 + 107 = 138 which is not 84.
- A possible setup 80 - (27 - 27) + 58: This simplifies to 80 + 0 + 58 = 138, not 84.
- Finally, (80 + 27) + 27 - 58 is 107 + 27 - 58 = 138, which is not 84.
- By trial and error, now (58 + 27) + (80 - 27) = 85 + 53 = 138.
- Conclusion, correct setup is: None combination validated above leading to 84. Let me start freshly: 
Start from: 80 - (27 - 27) + 58: This should clarify is - (27 - 27) actually zero which should be 58 + 80 = 138.
- Yet the simplest yet correct equation based is (80 + 27) - 58: It stands to be 107 - 58 = 49.
- Key mistake realized, now (80 + 58) - (27 + 27) = 138 - 54 = 84.

<think> First, let's examine the numbers we have: 36, 99, and 24. We need to create an equation that equals 87 using each number exactly once.
One way to approach this is to try different combinations of arithmetic operations.
Let's consider: (99 - 36) + 24
(99 - 36) = 63
63 + 24 = 87
This gives us our desired result of 87 using all the numbers exactly once.

<think> To create an equation using the numbers 21, 9, and 88 that equals 100, we need to consider different combinations of the operations (+, -, *, /) and test them.
- First, let's try multiplication and addition: 21 * 9 + 88 = 189 + 88 = 277 (which is too high)
- Next, let's try 88 + 21 + 9 = 118 (which is also too high)
- Now, let's try subtraction and addition: 88 + 21 - 9 = 100 (this equals exactly 100)
We found a combination that works: 88 + 21 - 9 = 100
</think>
<answer> 88 + 21 - 9 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 98, 43, and 51. We need to create an equation that equals 90 using each of these numbers exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by looking at possible combinations:
- 98 + 43 + 51 = 192 (This doesn't equal 90)
- 98 + 43 - 51 = 89 (This is close, but not equal to 90)
- 98 + 51 - 43 = 106 (This is too high)
- 98 - 43 + 51 = 106 (This is too high)
- 98 - 51 + 43 = 80 (This is too low)
- 43 + 51 - 98 = -13 (This is too low)
- 43 - 51 + 98 = 80 (This is too low)
- 51 + 43 - 98 = -4 (This is too low)
- 51 - 43 + 98 = 106 (This is too high)
It seems that combinations of addition and subtraction alone aren't yielding the correct result. Let's try multiplication and division:
- 98 * 43 / 51 = 83.666... (This is not an integer and not 90)
- 98 * 51 / 43 = 115.325... (This is not an integer and not 90)
- 43 * 51 / 98 = 22.098... (This is not an integer and not 90)
Finally, let's consider rearranging the possible operations:
(51 + 43) - 98 = 90
This shows us that the equation can be 51 + 43 - 98 = 90, since:
51 + 43 = 94
94 - 98 = -4 (This is incorrect in the context)
Thus, there seems to be no permutation of basic operations and numbers 98, 43, 51 that yields 90. However, checking a permutation:
(98 - 51) + 43 = 90
- 51 + 43 = 9
- 98 + 9 = 97 (Incorrect)
My initial assumption and step correction shows:
(98 + 43) - 51 = 90
- 98 + 43 + 51 = 90 (Correct)
Remember to use parentheses to keep these operations in the correct order:
(98 + 43) - 51 = 90
</think>
<answer> (98 + 43) - 51 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 5, 28, and 47. We need to create an equation that equals 80 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
- Adding the numbers: 5 + 28 + 47 = 80, but we need to use all numbers and the equation must use different operations.
- Subtracting: If we subtract 5 and 28 from 47, we get 47 - 5 - 28 = 14, which is not 80.
- Multiplying and adding: 5 * 28 + 47 = 140 + 47 = 187, which is too high.
- Multiplying and subtracting: 5 * (28 - 47) = 5 * (-19) = -95, which is not 80.
- Another combination: (28 * 47) - 5 = 1316 - 5 = 1311, which is too high.
- Rearranging terms: (47 + 28) - 5 = 75 - 5 = 70 is not 80 either.
Considering all the above, the only viable method left is rechecking combinations again closely. Hence, let's recheck the addition: 5 + 28 + 47 = 80, which is correct but it does not show use of all digits simultaneously as wanted. Inaccurate earlier options overcomplicating real checks:
Thus, finding 5 + 28 + 47 or (28 + 47 - 5) does work simpler methodically fitting desired results exactly fitting criteria finally. </think>
<answer> 5 + 28 + 47 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 49, 56, and 81. We need to create an equation that equals 24 using each number exactly once.
One approach is to try different combinations of the operations. Let's try to multiply and then subtract:
81 - 49 = 32
Then we would need to use 56 to get to 24, but this doesn't seem right as adding or subtracting 56 from 32 won't hit 24.
Let's try another combination:
(81 - 56) * 49 = 25 * 49 = 1225 (this is not 24)
Another idea is:
56 * 49 / 81
Calculating this:
56 * 49 = 2744
2744 / 81 ≈ 34.03
That's not 24 either.
Let's try:
56 + 81 - 49
56 + 81 = 137
137 - 49 = 88
This is far from 24, so it seems not working.
After several trials, I consider:
(81 - 56) + 49 = 25 + 49 = 74 (too high)
I could try (81 + 56) - 49 as:
81 + 56 = 137
137 - 49 = 88
This is also far from 24.
Realizing the constraints and finding the right combination, I see:
81 + 56 - 49
81 + 56 = 137
137 - 49 = 88 - Not right.
After these validations, I finally:
81 - (56 - 49)
81 - 7 = 74 - Not working.
Finally, an appropriate outcome:
I recognize: (56 - 49) * 81
56 - 49 = 7
7 * 81 = 567 - too high.
After several new trials, finally realized the right:
(56 + 81 - 49) must be right, but was failing before. 
After final realization and handling:
I judge that: (56 + 49) - 81
56 + 49 = 105
105 - 81 = 24.
Thus, correct last step: 
(56 + 49) - 81 
The final equation is: (56 + 49) - 81. 
Fine tuned conceptual user guidance is required - thus I realize:
(56 + 49) - 81 equals 24.
</think>
<answer>(56 + 49) - 81</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 1, 69, and 37. We need to create an equation that equals 32 using each number exactly once.
We can try different combinations of the arithmetic operations:
1 + 69 + 37 = 107 (not 32)
69 + 37 - 1 = 105 (not 32)
37 + 69 - 1 = 105 (not 32)
Let's try multiplication and addition:
(69 - 37) * 1 = 32 (This works! 37 - 69 gives -32, and multiplying by 1 gives 32)
So the equation is: (69 - 37) * 1 = 32
</think>
<answer> (69 - 37) * 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 51, 68, and 88. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once that equals 71.
We can try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
51 + 68 = 119 (not 71)
51 + 88 = 139 (not 71)
68 + 88 = 156 (not 71)
51 - 68 = -17 (not 71)
51 - 88 = -37 (not 71)
68 - 88 = -20 (not 71)
51 * 68 = 3488 (not 71)
51 * 88 = 4408 (not 71)
68 * 88 = 5984 (not 71)
Now let's try some combinations involving division:
51 / 68 = 0. 7529 (not 71)
51 / 88 = 0. 5818 (not 71)
68 / 51 ≈ 1. 3333 (not 71)
88 / 51 ≈ 1. 725 (not 71)
We realize we've considered these combinations but let's try a different approach:
(88 - 51) + 68 = 37 + 68 = 105 (not 71)
Next try:
(88 + 51) - 68 = 139 - 68 = 71
This combination results in the desired answer.
</think>
<answer>(88 + 51) - 68</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's examine the numbers we have: 19, 14, and 87. We need to combine these using basic arithmetic operations to get 54.
One approach is to try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
If we multiply 19 and 14: 19 * 14 = 266, which is far from 54. That won't work.
Let's try adding 19 and 14 first: 19 + 14 = 33. Now we need to get to 54 from 33 using the number 87. We can try: 33 + 87 = 120, which is too much.
What if we try 87 - 33: 87 - 33 = 54. That's exactly what we need!
So the equation is 87 - (19 + 14) = 54.
</think>
<answer> 87 - (19 + 14) </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to create an equation using the numbers 1, 1, and 24 that equals 12. Let's consider all possible combinations of these numbers with basic arithmetic operations.
- \(1 + 1 + 24 = 26\)
- \(1 + 1 \times 24 = 1 + 24 = 25\)
- \(1 \times 1 + 24 = 1 + 24 = 25\)
- \(1 \times 24 + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25\)
- \(\frac{1}{1} + 24 = 1 + 24 = 25\)
- \(\frac{1}{1} \times 24 = 1 \times 24 = 24\)
- \(24 - 1 - 1 = 22\)
None of the above combinations give us 12. Let's try another approach:
- \(24 - 1 - 1 = 22\) (This is already tried)
- \(24 - 1 + 1 = 24 - 1 + 1 = 24\) (This is already tried)
Upon re-examining, we realize that the operation \(24 / (1 + 1)\) could be the solution:
- \(\frac{24}{1+1} = \frac{24}{2} = 12\)
So, the equation works and we can confirm it.
</think>
<answer> 24 / (1 + 1) </answer>

<think> First, let's consider the numbers 42, 71, and 25. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result 54.
Let's try different combinations:
- 71 - 42 - 25 = 8 (not 54)
- 71 - 42 + 25 = 54 (this works)
So, the equation 71 - 42 + 25 equals 54.
</think>
<answer> 71 - 42 + 25 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 68, 59, and 72. We need to use each number exactly once to get a result of 63 using basic arithmetic operations.
- Adding or subtracting the numbers directly doesn't give us 63.
- Multiplying and then adding or subtracting doesn't seem to fit either.
Let's try a different combination: 72 - 59 + 68. 
72 - 59 = 13
Then, 13 + 68 = 81
This isn't correct.
Let me try another arrangement: 72 - 68 + 59
72 - 68 = 4
Then, 4 + 59 = 63
This combination fits our requirement.
</think>
<answer> 72 - 68 + 59 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 53, 86, 57, and 60. We need to use each number exactly once to get a result of 22 using basic arithmetic operations.
One way to approach this is to try different combinations of operations:
(86 - 57) - 53 + 60 = 29 - 53 + 60 = -24 + 60 = 36 (This doesn't work)
(86 - 53) - 57 + 60 = 33 - 57 + 60 = -24 + 60 = 36 (This doesn't work either)
(53 + 60) - 86 + 57 = 113 - 86 + 57 = 27 + 57 = 84 (This doesn't work)
(53 + 57) - 86 + 60 = 110 - 86 + 60 = 24 + 60 = 84 (This doesn't work)
Now, let's try another approach:
(86 - 57) + 53 - 60 = 29 + 53 - 60 = 82 - 60 = 22 (This works)
So, the equation that uses all the numbers exactly once and equals 22 is (86 - 57) + 53 - 60 = 22.
</think>
<answer> (86 - 57) + 53 - 60 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 85, 64, and 65. We need to create an expression that equals 44 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try different combinations:
- 85 - 64 - 65 = -44 (This is close but not quite right)
- 85 - 64 + 65 = 86 (This is too large)
- 85 + 64 - 65 = 84 (This is also too large)
- 65 + 64 - 85 = 44 (This looks promising)
- 65 + 85 - 64 = 86 (This is too large)
- 64 + 85 - 65 = 84 (This is too large)
The combination 65 + 64 - 85 equals 44, using each number exactly once.
</think>
<answer> 65 + 64 - 85 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 35, 13, 85, and 98. We need to create an equation that results in 35 using each number exactly once.
We can try different combinations of operations. Let's start with simpler combinations:
- 35 - 13 - 85 + 98 = 35 - 13 - 85 + 98 = 22 - 85 + 98 = -63 + 98 = 35
This combination works. So the equation is 35 - 13 - 85 + 98 = 35.
</think>
<answer> 35 - 13 - 85 + 98 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 69, 43, and 35. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get 61.
- Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- If we subtract 35 from 69, we get 34. Then if we subtract 43 from this result, we get -9. This isn't 61.
- Trying other combinations such as 69 + 43 - 35 gives 77 - 35 = 42, which is not 61.
- If we try 69 - (43 + 35), we get 69 - 78 = -9, which is still not 61.
- Let's try 69 - (43 * 35), but that would be a very large number and won't work.
- Trying again with a permutation, 69 - 43 + 35 would be 26 + 35 = 61. That seems to work.
So, the equation 69 - 43 + 35 equals 61.
</think>
<answer> 69 - 43 + 35 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 68, 42, and 6. We need to create an equation that equals 32 using each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by trying different combinations:
1. 68 - 42 - 6 = 20 (This is not 32)
2. 68 - 42 + 6 = 32 (This is 32, which is what we want)
So, the equation 68 - 42 + 6 equals 32.
</think>
<answer> 68 - 42 + 6 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 77, 45, and 75. We need to create an equation that equals 43 using each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
- Adding 77 and 45 gives 122.
- Subtracting 75 from 122 gives 47.
- Multiplying 75 by 45 gives 3375, which is too large.
- There are no other combinations of the three numbers using addition, subtraction, or multiplication that will result in 43.
Given the above, it seems like there might be a misunderstanding. Since no combination of +, -, *, / using the numbers 77, 45, 75 exactly once meets the criteria, let's consider a different approach:
- One way to get 43 with these numbers isn't directly possible through the operations mentioned. Given the numbers’ magnitude and the target result, combining them through division could be a consideration. 
- Dividing 77 by 75 gives approximately 1.03. Adding 45 to this would give about 46, which is close.
- However, we can use another combination involving the correct operations:
- 75 - (77 - 45) would evaluate to 75 - 32 = 43.
It appears upon this consistent re-evaluation the only valid equation combining all numbers, confidently yielding 43, is:
(75 - (77 - 45)) must be reviewed and was correctly calculated without an apparent other fit.

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 77, 45, and 75. We need to form an equation using each number exactly once that equals 43.
Let's try different combinations of operations:

<answer> 75 + 45 - 77 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 77, 45, and 75. We need to create an equation that equals 43 using each number exactly once.
We can start by trying different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
(77 - 75) + 45 = 2 + 45 = 47 (too high)
77 - (45 - 75) = 77 - (-20) = 97 (too high)
(77 + 45) - 75 = 122 - 75 = 47 (too high)
77 + (45 - 75) = 77 - 30 = 47 (too low)
75 + 45 - 77 = 120 - 77 = 43 (this works)
So the equation that equals 43 using the numbers 77, 45, and 75 exactly once is 75 + 45 - 77.

Let's try different combinations of operations:
- 77 - 45 - 75 doesn't work (since it's -167)
- 77 - 45 + 75 = 107 (too high)
- 77 + 45 - 75 = 47 (too high)
- 77 + (45 - 75) = 47 (still too high)
- 77 + 45 + 75 = 197 (too high)
- 45 + 77 - 75 = 47 (still too high)
- 77 - (45 - 75) = 107 (too high)
- 45 + 75 - 77 = 43 (this works)
So, the equation 45 + 75 - 77 equals 43.

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 77, 45, and 75. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 43.
Let's try different combinations:
- Adding or subtracting these numbers doesn't seem to work to get 43.
- Multiplying and dividing also doesn't directly give us 43.
Now let's try:
(77 + 45 - 75) = 127 (This is too large)
(77 - 45 + 75) = 107 (This is also too large)
(45 + 75 - 77) = 43 (This equals 43)
So the equation (45 + 75 - 77) gives us 43 using the numbers exactly once.

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 99, 9, and 91. We need to combine these numbers using basic arithmetic operations to get 17.
We can start by looking at the numbers and what operations might yield 17:
- 99 - 91 = 8
- 99 - 81 = 18 (but we don't have 81)
- 99 + 91 = 192 (too large)
- 99 + 8 = 107 (too large)
- 91 - 9 = 82 (too large)
- 91 + 9 = 100 (too large)
- By considering combinations, we notice:
99 - 82 = 17
But 82 isn't part of our numbers. Now, combining other pairs:
99 - (91 - 9) = 99 - 82 = 17
We can confirm this equation is correct because 99 - 82 does indeed equal 17.
</think>
<answer> 99 - (91 - 9) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 99, 9, and 91. We need to create an equation that equals 17 using each number exactly once.
Let's try different combinations:
- 99 - 91 = 8 (not 17)
- 99 - 9 = 90 (not 17)
- 99 - 91 - 9 = -11 (not 17)
- 91 - 99 - 9 = -17 (not 17)
- 91 - 9 = 82 (not 17)
- 91 + 9 - 99 = 1 (not 17)
- 99 + 9 - 91 = 17 (This looks promising)
Thus, the equation 99 + 9 - 91 equals 17.

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 51, 19, and 5. We need to create an equation that equals 65 using each number exactly once and basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try different combinations:
(51 + 19) + 5 = 70 (which is too high)
51 + (19 + 5) = 75 (which is also too high)
51 + 19 - 5 = 65 (this could be it)
51 - 19 + 5 = 37 (which is too low)
So, the correct equation seems to be 51 + 19 - 5 = 65.

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 32, 30, and 89. We need to create an equation that equals 91 using each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by looking at the target number and the numbers we have:
91 - 32 = 59
59 - 30 = 29
29 + 89 = 118 (This isn't 91)
We can try other combinations:
32 + 30 = 62
62 + 89 = 151 (This isn't 91)
Now let's try:
89 - 32 = 57
57 - 30 = 27 (This doesn't lead to 91)
Let's try:
32 + 89 = 121
121 - 30 = 91 (This works)
So, the equation is:
32 + 89 - 30 = 91
</think>
<answer> 32 + 89 - 30 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 32, 30, and 89. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to equal 91.
We can try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
- 89 + 32 + 30 = 151 (This is too high)
- 89 + 32 - 30 = 91 (This seems to be our target)
- 89 + 30 + 32 = 151 (This is also too high)
- 89 - 32 + 30 = 87 (This is too low)
- 32 + 89 - 30 = 91 (This also equals 91)
From these combinations, we can see that both 89 + 32 - 30 and 32 + 89 - 30 result in 91. However, the problem specifies that each number can only be used once, and both equations use all three numbers, so either is correct.

- 54 + 49 - 34 = 69 (this equals 69)
- 54 - 49 + 34 = 41 (not 69)
- 54 * 49 / 34 = 74.706 (not 69)
- 34 * 49 / 54 = 31.303 (not 69)
From the above calculations, we can see that 54 + 49 - 34 equals 69.

- Let's try: 94 - 15 - 14 - 3
  The subtraction gives us: 94 - 15 = 79

- 88 - 52 + 60 = 96 (not 80)
- 88 + 52 - 60 = 80 (this equals 80)
So, the equation 88 + 52 - 60 equals 80.

- 12 - 20 + 10 = 2
- 12 + 20 - 10 = 22
- 20 + 12 - 10 = 22
- 12 + (20 / 10) = 14
- (20 + 12) / 10 = 3.2
From these, the combination 12 + (20 / 10) equals 14.

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 88, 17, and 20. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 51. Let's try different combinations of arithmetic operations.
One way to approach this is to look for relationships between the numbers. Notice that 88 - 20 = 68, which is quite far from 51. Let's try 88 - 17 first: this equals 71, which is also not 51. 
Now, let's try adding the remaining numbers: 88 + 17 + 20 = 125, which is too large.
Next, let's try 88 + 20 - 17: this equals 88 + 20 = 108, then subtract 17 and this is 108 - 17 = 91, still not 51.
What if we rearrange and subtract 20 first: 88 - 20 = 68, then add the remaining number 17: 68 + 17 = 85, not 51.
Now, let's try 88 and 20, and subtract 17 in reverse order: 
88 - 20 = 68, then subtract 17 from this result: 68 - 17 = 51.
This works!
</think>
<answer> 88 - 20 - 17 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 88, 17, and 20. We need to create an equation that equals 51 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
We can try different combinations:
88 + 17 + 20 = 125 (This is too high)
88 + 17 - 20 = 85 (This is also too high)
88 - 17 + 20 = 91 (Still too high)
88 - (17 + 20) = 51 (This equals 51)
So, the equation that uses the numbers 88, 17, and 20 exactly once to get 51 is 88 - (17 + 20) = 51.
</think>
<answer> 88 - (17 + 20) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 88, 17, and 20. We need to create an equation that equals 51 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
- Let's try different combinations:
  - 88 - 17 - 20 = 51 (This works as 88 - 17 = 71 and 71 - 20 = 51)
  - Other combinations like 88 - (17 + 20), 17 - 88 + 20, etc., do not yield 51.
Therefore, the correct equation is 88 - 17 - 20 = 51.
</think>
<answer> 88 - 17 - 20 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 2, 1, 40, and 88. We need to create an equation that equals 47 using each number exactly once.
We can start trying different combinations of operations:
- 88 - 40 - 1 - 2 = 45 (doesn't work)
- 88 - 40 - 2 - 1 = 45 (doesn't work)
- 88 - 40 + 1 + 2 = 51 (doesn't work)
- 88 + 40 - 1 - 2 = 125 (doesn't work)
- 88 + 40 + 1 - 2 = 127 (doesn't work)
- 88 + 40 + 2 - 1 = 129 (doesn't work)
- 88 + 1 + 40 + 2 = 131 (doesn't work)
- 40 + 88 + 1 + 2 = 131 (doesn't work)
- 2 + 1 + 40 + 88 = 131 (doesn't work)
Now let's try another approach:
- (88 + 40) - (2 + 1) = 128 - 3 = 125 (didn't get 47)
- (88 + 40) + (1 + 2) = 128 + 3 = 131 (doesn't work)
- (88 + 1) - (40 + 2) = 89 - 42 = 47 (this works)
So, the equation that equals 47 is (88 + 1) - (40 + 2).
</think>
<answer>(88 + 1) - (40 + 2)</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider all possible combinations of 72, 44, and 35 using basic arithmetic operations. We need to achieve the number 63.
- 72 - 44 - 35 = -8 (This is not 63)
- 72 - 44 + 35 = 63 (This equals 63, which is what we want)
- 72 + 44 - 35 = 81 (This is not 63)
- 72 + 44 + 35 = 151 (This is not 63)
- 44 - 72 + 35 = 7 (This is not 63)
- 35 - 72 + 44 = -33 (This is not 63)
From the above calculations, we can see that 72 - 44 + 35 = 63 is the correct equation.
</think>
<answer> 72 - 44 + 35 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 25, 10, and 78. We need to create an equation that equals 63 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
- Let's try different combinations:
  - 78 - 25 - 10 = 43 (This is not 63)
  - 78 - 25 + 10 = 68 (This is not 63)
  - 78 + 25 - 10 = 93 (This is not 63)
  - 78 + 25 + 10 = 113 (This is not 63)
  - 78 + (25 - 10) = 83 (This is not 63)
  - (78 + 25) - 10 = 93 - 10 = 83 (This is not 63)
  - 78 + 10 - 25 = 88 - 25 = 63 (This is correct)
So, the equation works. Let's confirm it: 78 + 10 - 25 = 63.
</think>
<answer> 78 + 10 - 25 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 3, 5, and 22. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 30.
One way to approach this is to try different combinations of operations. Let's try:
22 - 5 = 17
Now we need 13 more to reach 30. We can get 13 by doing:
17 + 3 = 20
But 3 is not available. Let's try another combination:
3 + 5 = 8
Then we need 22 more to reach 30. So the equation becomes:
8 + 22 = 30
This works because 8 + 22 indeed equals 30.
</think>
<answer> (3 + 5) + 22 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 39, 39, and 9. We need to create an equation that equals 87 using each number exactly once.
We can try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
- 39 + 39 + 9 = 87 (This works because 39 + 39 equals 78, and 78 + 9 equals 87)
Since this combination uses all numbers and results in 87, we have found our solution.
</think>
<answer> 39 + 39 + 9 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 39, 39, and 9. We need to create an equation that equals 87 using these numbers exactly once.
One way to approach this is by combining the numbers in a way that naturally lends itself to producing 87.
Let's try adding the first two numbers and then adding the third one:
39 + 39 + 9
This gives us:
88 + 9 = 97
That's close but not quite 87. Let's try another combination:
39 + 39 - 9
This gives us:
88 - 9 = 79
That's still not 87. Let's try another strategy:
39 + 9 + 39
This gives us:
48 + 39 = 87
This combination gives us the right result. So, 39 + 9 + 39 = 87.
</think>
<answer> 39 + 9 + 39 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 56, 35, and 7. We need to create an equation that equals 14 using each number exactly once and with any combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Let's try different combinations:
- 56 - 35 - 7 = 14 (This works since 56 minus 35 equals 21, and then 21 minus 7 equals 14)
This gives us a valid equation.
</think>
<answer> 56 - 35 - 7 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 18, 63, and 22. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 77.
Let's try different combinations:
- 63 - 18 - 22 = 23 (not 77)
- 63 - 18 + 22 = 67 (not 77)
- 63 + 18 - 22 = 59 (not 77)
- 63 + 18 + 22 = 103 (not 77)
- 22 + 63 - 18 = 67 (not 77)
- 22 + 63 + 18 = 103 (not 77)
It seems none of the simple combinations work. Let's consider using multiplication or another operation:
- 63 * 22 / 18 = 77 (1386 / 18 = 77)
This combination works because:
63 * 22 = 1386
1386 / 18 = 77
So the equation is correct.
</think>
<answer> 63 * 22 / 18 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 81, 69, and 65. We need to create an equation that equals 85 using each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by looking at the difference between some of these numbers:
81 - 65 = 16
This gives us 16, which is not 85.
Now let's try adding some numbers:
81 + 69 = 150
This is too high.
Let's try:
81 + 65 - 69 = 77
This is also not 85.
Let's try a different combination:
69 + 65 - 81 = 53
This is not 85 either.
Now let's try:
69 + (81 - 65) = 69 + 16 = 85
This gives us the desired result of 85.
So the equation is 69 + (81 - 65) = 85.
</think>
<answer> 69 + (81 - 65) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 81, 69, and 65. We need to create an equation that equals 85 using each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try different combinations:
- 81 - 69 + 65 = 83 (not 85)
- 81 + 69 - 65 = 85 (this is 85)
This combination works. So, the equation is 81 + 69 - 65 = 85.
</think>
<answer> 81 + 69 - 65 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 85, 27, and 2. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 56.
- Let's start by adding or subtracting the smaller numbers to see if we can get closer to 56.
- Adding 27 and 27 gives us 54, which is close but not 56.
- Subtracting 2 from 85 gives us 83, which is too high.
- Now let's try a combination: 85 - 27 + 2. This gives us 60 - 27 + 2 = 33 + 2 = 35, which is still not 56.
- Let's try another approach: 85 - 27 - 2. This gives us 58 - 2 = 56.
So, 85 - 27 - 2 equals 56.

<answer> 85 - 27 - 2 </answer>

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 47, 70, and 33. We need to create an equation that equals 10 using each number exactly once with the allowed operations.
Let's try different combinations:
47 - 70 + 33 = 10
Now let's check:
47 - 70 = -23
-23 + 33 = 10
This calculation works, so the equation is correct.
</think>
<answer> 47 - 70 + 33 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 73, 24, and 14. We need to create an equation that equals 83 using each number exactly once and by using basic arithmetic operations.
- One way to approach this is to try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Let's try: 73 + 24 - 14
  73 + 24 = 97
  97 - 14 = 83
- This combination gives us the desired result of 83.
</think>
<answer> 73 + 24 - 14 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 86, 72, and 69. We need to create an equation that results in 55 using each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try different combinations:
- 86 - 72 - 69 = -135 (not 55)
- 86 - 72 + 69 = 83 (not 55)
- 86 + 72 - 69 = 99 (not 55)
- 86 + 72 + 69 = 227 (not 55)
- 69 + 72 - 86 = 55 (this is 55)
We found a combination that works: 69 + 72 - 86 = 55.
</think>
<answer> 69 + 72 - 86 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 84, 28, and 76 exactly once to get 36. Let's try different combinations of the operations:
- 84 - 28 - 76 = -60 (Not 36)
- 84 - 28 + 76 = 132 (Not 36)
- 84 + 28 - 76 = 36 (This could be the solution)
- 84 + 28 + 76 = 188 (Not 36)
- 84 - (28 - 76) = 132 (Not 36)
- 84 * (28 - 76) (Not valid as it results in a negative number and is out of scope for basic arithmetic here)
From the above combinations, we see that 84 + 28 - 76 equals 36.
 </think>
<answer> 84 + 28 - 76 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 31, 31, 38, and 55. We need to create an equation that equals 93 using each of these numbers exactly once.
We can start by adding or subtracting the smaller numbers to see if we get closer to 93.
31 + 31 = 62, which is too low.
31 + 38 = 69, which is still too low.
31 + 55 = 86, which is still a bit low.
Let's try a different combination: 31 + 38 + 55 = 124, which is too high.
Now, let's try a combination involving subtraction:
38 + 55 - 31 = 62, which is not 93.
Let's try another: 38 + 31 - 55 = 14, which is not 93.
Now, let's try: (55 - 31) + (38 + 31) = 24 + 69 = 93.
This seems to fit our requirement as 55 - 31 = 24 and 38 + 31 = 69, and their sum is 93.
</think>
<answer> (55 - 31) + (38 + 31) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 31, 31, 38, and 55. We need to combine these using basic arithmetic operations to get 93.
One way to approach this is to try different combinations:
- 31 + 31 + 31 = 93 (but we can't use 31 twice)
- 31 + 31 + 38 = 90 (too low)
- 31 + 31 + 55 = 117 (too high)
- 31 + 38 + 31 = 100 (too high)
- 31 + 55 + 31 = 117 (too high)
- 31 + 55 + 38 = 124 (too high)
- 31 * 31 + 38 = 962 (too high)
- 38 * 31 = 1178 (too high)
Now, let's try another combination:
31 + 38 + 31 = 99 (too high)
31 * 31 + 55 - 38 = 933 (too high)
38 + 31 + 55 - 31 = 113 (too high)
Remember another combination:
31 + 31 + 38 + 31 = 121 (too high)
Only one combination appears to work: 31 + 31 + 38
But 31 + 31 + 38 = 100
Since above combination isn't working any other combination appears unfeasible.
Actually re-checking possible combinations to see if fit the need more carefully:
31 + 55 + 31 + 31 - 38 = 93
But we couldn't use addition in whole step since 31 and 31 didn't lasted equation here.
Also re-check now:
31 + 31 + 55 - 38 = 89 (too low)
So detailed re-check of possible solving is:
Here right possible way given the assumptions is:
31 + 55 + 38 - 31 = 93
So definitely proved via used two moves which works well.
</think>
<answer> 31 + 55 + 38 - 31 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 31, 31, 38, and 55. We need to create an equation that equals 93 using each number exactly once.
One way to approach this is to try different combinations of operations. Let's try: 31 + 38 + 55 - 31
1. Calculate 31 + 38 = 69
2. Then add 55 to the result: 69 + 55 = 124
3. Finally, subtract the last 31: 124 - 31 = 93
This gives us the correct result of 93. So the equation is 31 + 38 + 55 - 31 = 93.

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 66, 47, and 39. We need to create an equation that equals 74 using these numbers exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try different combinations:
- 66 + 47 + 39 = 152 (which is not 74)
- 66 + 47 - 39 = 74 (this looks promising)
- 66 - 47 + 39 = 58 (which is not 74)
- 66 * 47 / 39 = 76.37 (which is not 74)
- 66 / 47 + 39 = 49.39 (which is not 74)
From these combinations, we can see that 66 + 47 - 39 equals 74.

<answer> 66 + 47 - 39 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 97, 18, 43, and 47. We need to create an equation that equals 25 using each number exactly once.
- Let's try combining 97 and 18 first: 97 - 18 = 79, which is too large.
- Trying 97 - 43 = 54, still too large.
- 97 - 47 = 50, closer but still too high.
- Let's try 97 - (18 + 43 + 47): This doesn't work since we can't use a number more than once.
- Now let's try another approach: 97 - 47 - 18 - 43. This combination doesn't work either.
- Since none of the above combinations worked, let's try calculating different orders. For instance, let's try 97 + 18 - 47 - 43. Let's verify: This gives 97 + 18 = 115, then 115 - 47 = 68, and finally 68 - 43 = 25, it works!
So, the equation is 97 + 18 - 47 - 43 = 25.
</think>
<answer> 97 + 18 - 47 - 43 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider all possible combinations using the numbers 76, 9, and 5 with the basic arithmetic operations. We need to create an equation that equals 62.
- 76 - 9 - 5 = 62 (Here, 76 is the largest number and could be the starting point. Subtracting 9 and 5 from it gives 62)
- 76 - (9 - 5) = 62 (Another possibility, but this simplifies to 72 which is not 62)
- 76 + 9 - 5 = 80 (Adding 9 and 76 gives 85, and subtracting 5 gives 80, not 62)
- 76 + (9 - 5) = 80 (This simplifies to 80, not 62)
- 9 + 5 + 76 = 80 (This sums up to 80, not 62)
From the above combinations, the correct equation is 76 - 9 - 5 = 62.

<answer> 76 - 9 - 5 </answer>

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 33, 4, 88, and 38. We need to create an equation that equals 87 using each number exactly once.
Let's try different combinations:
- 33 + 4 + 88 + 38: This equals 163, which is too high.
- 88 + 38 + 4 - 33: This equals 99 - 33 = 66, which is too low.
- 88 + 33 + 4 - 38: This equals 121 - 38 = 83, which is close but still not 87.
- 88 + 33 - 4 + 38: This equals 121 + 38 - 4 = 155 - 4 = 151, which is too high.
Let's try another combination:
- 38 + 88 + 4 - 33: This equals 126 - 33 = 93, which is still not correct.
After trying these combinations, let's try another promising combination:
- 88 - 38 - 4 + 33: This equals (50) - 4 + 33 = 46 + 33 = 79, still not correct.
Finally, let's try:
- 88 - 38 + 4 + 33: This equals 50 + 37 = 87.
This combination works, so the equation is 88 - 38 + 4 + 33 = 87.

<answer> 88 - 38 + 4 + 33 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 94, 91, and 80. We need to create an equation using these numbers only once each to equal 77.
One way to approach this is to look for combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
If we subtract 91 and 80 from 94, we get:
94 - 91 - 80 = 93 - 80 = 13
This doesn't work. Let's try another combination.
If we add 94 and 91, and then subtract 80:
94 + 91 - 80 = 185 - 80 = 105
This is too high. Let's try another:
If we add 91 and 80, and then subtract 94:
91 + 80 - 94 = 171 - 94 = 77
This works because 91 + 80 = 171, and then 171 - 94 = 77.
So the equation is 91 + 80 - 94 = 77.
</think>
<answer> 91 + 80 - 94 </answer>

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 4, 32, and 49. We need to use each number exactly once to get the result of 85 using basic arithmetic operations.
- One way to approach this is to try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Let's try: 49 + 32 - 4
  49 + 32 = 81
  81 - 4 = 77
This doesn't give us 85. Let's try another combination.
- Now let's try: 32 + 49 - 4
  32 + 49 = 81
  81 - 4 = 77
This also doesn't work.
- Let's try: 49 + (32 - 4)
  32 - 4 = 28
  49 + 28 = 77
This doesn't give us 85 either.
- Now let's try: (49 - 32) + 4
  49 - 32 = 17
  17 + 4 = 21
This also doesn't give us 85.
- Let's try: (32 - 4) + 49
  32 - 4 = 28
  28 + 49 = 77
This also doesn't give us 85.
- Now let's try: 49 * 2 + 32 - 4
  49 * 2 = 98
  98 + 32 = 130
  130 - 4 = 126
This doesn't give us 85.
- Finally, let's try: 32 * 2 + 49 - 4
  32 * 2 = 64
  64 + 49 = 113
  113 - 4 = 109
This also doesn't give us 85.
- We tried all possible combinations and none of them gave us 85.
- Revisiting our initial simpler approach might give different results.
- Let's try: (49 + 32) - 4
  49 + 32 = 81
  81 - 4 = 77
This also didn't work.
- Now trying the simplest remaining that correct way:
- Winning combination would be: 49 + 32 - 4
  Still confused, again looks simplest,
- Finally tried:
- Actual right combination should be: 49 + 32 + 4
  This finally right calculation - realizing.
So final equation: 49 + 32 + 4 equals 85.

<think> First, let's consider all possible combinations of the numbers 54, 98, 71, and 97 using the basic arithmetic operations to see if we can get 18. We can start by trying different pairs and see if we can reach the target.
(98 + 71) - 97 - 54 = 170 - 97 - 54 = 73 - 54 = 19 (not 18)
(98 + 54) - 97 - 71 = 152 - 97 - 71 = 55 - 71 = -16 (not 18)
(98 + 54) - 71 - 97 = 152 - 71 - 97 = 81 - 97 = -16 (not 18)
98 - (54 + 71) - 97 = 98 - 125 - 97 = -27 - 97 = -124 (not 18)
98 - (54 + 97) - 71 = 98 - 151 - 71 = -53 - 71 = -124 (not 18)
98 - (71 + 54) - 97 = 98 - 125 - 97 = -27 - 97 = -124 (not 18)
98 - (71 + 97) - 54 = 98 - 168 - 54 = -70 - 54 = -124 (not 18)
54 + (98 - 71) - 97 = 54 + 27 - 97 = 81 - 97 = -16 (not 18)
For a correct result:
(98 + 71) - 54 - 97 = 169 - 54 - 97 = 115 - 97 = 18
So, the correct equation is (98 + 71) - 54 - 97 = 18.

<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 93, 96, and 92. We need to create an equation that equals 97 using each number exactly once.
Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
- 96 + 92 - 93 = 95 (not 97)
- 96 + 93 - 92 = 97 (this could work)
- 96 - 93 + 92 = 95 (not 97)
- 93 + 96 - 92 = 97 (this also works)
Among these, both 96 + 93 - 92 and 93 + 96 - 92 equal 97. However, we need to provide only one final equation.

Let's try different combinations:
- 96 - 92 + 93 = 100 (not 97)
- 96 + 92 - 93 = 95 (not 97)
- 96 + 93 - 92 = 97 (this looks promising)

- First, let's try combinations with addition and subtraction:
  - 80 + 54 - 75 = 134 - 75 = 59 (not 49)
  - 80 + 75 - 54 = 155 - 54 = 101 (not 49)
  - 54 + 75 - 80 = 129 - 80 = 49 (this works)
- The combination 54 + 75 - 80 equals 49.
</think>
<answer> 54 + 75 - 80 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 80, 54, and 75. We need to create an equation using these numbers only once each to get the result of 49.
Let's try different combinations:
- 80 - 54 - 75 = -89 (not 49)
- 80 - 54 + 75 = 91 (not 49)
- 80 + 54 - 75 = 59 (not 49)
- 80 + 54 + 75 = 212 (not 49)
- 54 - 75 + 80 = 99 (not 49)
- 75 - 54 + 80 = 101 (not 49)
- 75 + 54 - 80 = 49 (this looks promising)
Thus, the equation that uses the numbers 80, 54, and 75 exactly once to equal 49 is 75 + 54 - 80.

==============
<think> First, let's consider all possible combinations of the numbers 63, 22, 45, and 97 using basic arithmetic operations. We need an equation that equals 57.
One approach is to try different operations between pairs of numbers:
63 + 22 = 85 (which is not 57)
63 - 22 = 41 (which is not 57)
63 * 22 = 1386 (which is not 57)
63 / 22 = 2.8636 (which is not 57)
22 + 45 = 67 (which is not 57)
22 + 63 = 85 (which is not 57)
45 + 63 = 108 (which is not 57)
45 + 22 = 67 (which is not 57)
97 - 45 = 52 (which is not 57)
97 - 63 = 34 (which is not 57)
97 - 22 = 75 (which is not 57)
By trying all combinations, we haven't found a solution yet. Let's try another approach:
(63 - 45) + 22 = 18 + 22 = 40 (which is not 57)
We need to try the numbers in different orders. Let's try:
(97 - 63) + 22 = 34 + 22 = 56 (which is not 57)
(97 - 45) + 22 = 52 + 22 = 74 (which is not 57)
We still haven't found it. Let's try:
63 + (45 - 22) = 63 + 23 = 86 (which is not 57)
We are still close, but we need to check:
(63 + 45) - 22 = 108 - 22 = 86 (which is not 57)
(63 + 45) - 97 = 108 - 97 = 11 (which is not 57)
Finally, let's check:
97 - (63 + 22) = 97 - 85 = 12 (which is not 57)
Lastly, check:
(97 - 45) - 63 = 52 - 63 = -11 (which is not 57)
And check:
(97 - 63) - 45 = 34 - 45 = -11 (which is not 57)
After all tests, we finally have:
97 - (63 + 22 - 45) = 97 - 38 = 59, This is also not 57.
Therefore we need to check:
For final solution,
let's try:
97 - 63 - 22 + 45 = 97 - 63 - 22 + 45 = 97 - 85 = 12 (no)
Now let's consider:
(97 - 63) - (22 - 45) = 34 - (-23) = 57
</think>
<answer>(97 - 63) - (22 - 45)</answer>

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 13, 28, 85, and 47. We need to create an equation that equals 53 using each number exactly once.
Let's try different combinations:
- 85 - 28 - 13 = 44 (This is close but not 53)
- 85 - 28 + 13 = 70 (Still not 53)
- 85 + 28 - 13 = 100 (Too high)
- 47 + 28 + 13 = 88 (Too high)
- 85 + 13 - 28 = 69 (Still not 53)
- 47 + 85 - 28 = 104 (Too high)
- 28 + 47 + 13 = 88 (Too high)
- 85 + 28 + 47 - 13 = 147 (Too high)
After trying various combinations, it seems I've missed a simple combination. Let's try:
- 85 + 28 - 47 - 13 = 53
This combination works as it uses all the numbers exactly once and equals 53.
</think>
<answer> 85 + 28 - 47 - 13 </answer>

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 34, 44, and 60. We need to create an equation that equals 50 using each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try different combinations:
- 34 + 44 + 60 = 138 (too high)
- 60 + 44 - 34 = 70 (too high)
- 60 + 34 - 44 = 50 (this could work)
So, the equation that equals 50 using the numbers 34, 44, and 60 is 60 + 34 - 44.

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 11, 9, 84, and 38. We need to create an equation that equals 53 using each number exactly once.
Let's try different combinations:
- 84 - 38 - 11 - 9 = 36 (too high)
- 84 - 38 + 11 - 9 = 58 (too high)
- 84 - 38 + 11 + 9 = 66 (too high)
- 84 + 38 - 11 - 9 = 102 (too high)
- 84 + 38 - 11 + 9 = 120 (too high)
- 84 + 38 + 11 - 9 = 124 (too high)
- 11 + 9 + 84 - 38 = 66 (too high)
- 11 + 9 + 38 - 84 = -26 (too low)
- 11 + 9 + 84 + 38 = 142 (too high)
It seems like no straightforward combination works. Let's try some other orders:
11 + 9 * 84 / 38 = 115.5 (not an integer)
We didn't get an integer before. Let's try another simple one:
9 + 84 - 11 * 38 = 9 + 84 - 418 = -225 (too low)
Trying another simpler combination:
9 * 84 / 11 + 38 = 75.45 (not an integer)
It's clear the straightforward combination of the numbers hasn't yielded 53. Moving onto another:
Next let's simply try:
11 * 9 - 84 + 38 = 99 - 84 + 38 = 53 (match)
Thus, the equation is correct.

54 + 84 - 67 = 71 (This is too low)
54 + 67 - 84 = 37 (This is too low)
84 + 67 - 54 = 97 (This could be the correct equation)
Let's verify: 84 + 67 - 54 = 97
This equation is correct.

- 54 + 84 - 67 = 71 (Not 97)
- 54 + 67 - 84 = 37 (Not 97)

<think> First, we need to create an equation using the numbers 82, 29, and 1 that equals 54. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
- 82 + 29 + 1 = 112 (not 54)
- 82 + 29 - 1 = 100 (not 54)
- 82 + 29 * 1 = 111 (not 54)
- 82 * 29 + 1 = 2379 (not 54)
- 82 * (29 - 1) = 82 * 28 = 2296 (not 54)
- 29 * 1 + 82 = 111 (not 54)
- (82 - 29) + 1 = 54 (this equals 54)
So, the equation that uses the numbers 82, 29, and 1 exactly once and results in 54 is (82 - 29) + 1.

<answer> (82 - 29) + 1 </answer>

- 82 - 29 + 1 = 54 (this could work)
- 82 + 29 - 1 = 100 (too high)

The combination 82 - 29 + 1 gives us 54 exactly.

- 92 - 35 - 47 + 27 = 47 (not 77)
- 92 - 35 + 47 - 27 = 82 (not 77)
- 92 - (35 + 47 - 27) = 92 - 55 = 37 (not 77)
- (92 + 35) - (47 + 27) = 127 - 74 = 53 (not 77)
- (92 + 35 + 27) - 47 = 154 - 47 = 107 (not 77)
- (92 + 47) - (35 + 27) = 139 - 62 = 77 (This equals 77)
So, the equation (92 + 47) - (35 + 27) equals 77.
</think>
<answer>(92 + 47) - (35 + 27)</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers [92, 35, 47, 27] and try to form an equation that equals 77 using each number exactly once. We can start by adding or subtracting these numbers and see if we get closer to 77.
- 92 + 35 + 47 + 27 = 191 (too high)
- 92 + 35 + 47 - 27 = 147 (still too high)
- 92 + 35 - 47 + 27 = 107 (still too high)
- 92 + 35 - 47 - 27 = 53 (too low)
- 92 - 35 + 47 + 27 = 131 (too high)
- 92 - 35 + 47 - 27 = 81 (still too high)
- 92 - 35 - 47 + 27 = 49 (too low)
- 35 + 47 + 27 - 92 = 17 (too low)
- 35 + 47 - 92 + 27 = 9 (too low)
Finally, let's try a different combination:
- 92 - (35 + 47 - 27) = 92 - 55 = 37 (still not 77)
Consider another way:
- (92 + 47) - (35 + 27) = 139 - 62 = 77
This combination fits our target result of 77.

<answer>(92 + 47) - (35 + 27)</answer>

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 99, 38, 16, and 65. We need to create an equation that equals 88 using each number exactly once.
Let's try different combinations:
99 - 38 - 16 - 65 = 60 (not 88)
99 - 38 - 16 + 65 = 100 (not 88)
99 - 38 + 16 - 65 = 22 (not 88)
99 + 38 - 16 - 65 = 66 (not 88)
99 + 38 + 16 - 65 = 88 (this works! )
So, the correct equation is 99 + 38 + 16 - 65 = 88.

<answer> 99 + 38 + 16 - 65 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 69, 99, and 34. We need to form an equation using these numbers only once, that equals 64.
Let's try different combinations:
- 99 - 69 = 30
- 99 - 34 = 65
- 69 - 34 = 35
None of these give us 64.
- 69 + 99 = 168
This is too high.
- 99 + 34 = 133
This is also too high.
Now let's try multiplication and subtraction:
- 99 * 34 / 69
Calculating this: 99 * 34 = 3366
3366 / 69 = 51.6666667
This is not 64.
Given that none of the straightforward combinations were correct, let's verify every possible lesser complex computation:
Let's check single figures:
None of the individual numbers can be used alone to give 64.
As no suitable direct calculation was possible, let's begin revisiting the possibility with computations - 
69 - 34 = 35, and now
35 + 29 is not given and directly checking:
Now 99 + 34 = 133, then 99 + 34 - 69 = 68 (then recheck close)
Last check:
99 + 34 - 69 = 64
Let's verify this equation:
99 + 34 = 133
133 - 69 = 64

- 69 - 16 + 21 = 74
- 69 + 16 - 21 = 64
- 69 + 16 + 21 = 106
From the combinations above, we can see that:
69 - 16 + 21 = 74
This equation uses all the numbers exactly once and results in the desired outcome of 74.

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 95, 56, and 48. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 87.
One effective approach is to try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Let's try different combinations:
95 - 56 - 48 = -11 (too low)
95 - 56 + 48 = 87 (this looks promising)
95 - 48 - 56 = -5 (too low)
56 - 95 + 48 = -1 (too low)
48 - 95 + 56 = 9 (too high)
None of the above combinations worked except for 95 - 56 + 48 = 87.
So, the correct equation is 95 - 56 + 48 = 87.

  76 - 17 equals 59, and then 59 - 12 equals 47.
This combination works. So the equation is 76 - 17 - 12 = 47.

- 91 - 9 - 39 + 36 = 89 (too low)
- 91 - 9 + 39 - 36 = 95 (too low)
- 91 + 9 - 39 - 36 = 25 (too low)
- 91 + 9 - 39 + 36 = 97 (this looks promising)
Thus, the equation 91 + 9 - 39 + 36 equals 97.

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 36, 97, and 35. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 98.
We can start by looking at the possible combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
- 36 + 97 + 35 = 168 (not 98)
- 97 + 36 + 35 = 168 (not 98)
- 97 - 36 - 35 = 26 (not 98)
- 97 - 36 + 35 = 96 (not 98)
- 97 * 35 = 3395 (not 98)
- 97 / 35 = 2.7714 (not 98)
- 36 * 35 = 1260 (not 98)
- 35 * 36 = 1260 (not 98)
- 36 / 35 = 1.0286 (not 98)
- 35 / 36 = 0.9722 (not 98)
After checking all these combinations, it seems none of them work. However, let's check another way around:
97 - (36 / 35) = 96.8857 (not 98)
97 / (36 / 35) = 35.7205 (not 98)
Let's try:
36 + 97 - 35 = 98
This combination seems to work.

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 36, 97, and 35. We need to create an equation using each number exactly once to get the result of 98.
- We can start by looking at the sum of 36 and 35: 36 + 35 = 71.
- Next, we need to reach 98 from 71. We can do this by adding 27 to 71. However, we don't have a 27, so let's check the numbers we have differently.
- Now, let's try 97 - 35: 97 - 35 = 62.
- To get to 98 from 62, we need to add 36: 62 + 36 = 98.
This way, we are using all the numbers exactly once and achieving the target result.

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 87, 14, and 9. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 64.
Let's try different combinations:
- 87 - 14 - 9 = 64 (This works since 87 - 14 = 73 and 73 - 9 = 64)
- Other combinations like (87 + 14 + 9) or any other operation won't yield 64.
So, the equation that uses the numbers 87, 14, and 9 exactly once and equals 64 is 87 - 14 - 9.

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 35, 97, and 33. We need to create an equation that equals 99 using each number exactly once.
Let's try combining the numbers and operations:
- 97 - 35 = 62
- 62 + 33 = 95 (This is close but not equal to 99)
- Now let's try another combination:
- 97 - 33 = 64
- 64 + 35 = 99
So, the equation 97 - 33 + 35 equals 99.
</think>
<answer> 97 - 33 + 35 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 87, 65, and 13. We need to create an equation that equals 35 using each number exactly once with the basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try different combinations:
- 87 - 65 - 13 = 87 - 78 = 9 (not 35)
- 87 - 65 + 13 = 87 - 52 = 35 (this looks promising)
- 87 + 65 - 13 = 152 - 13 = 139 (not 35)
- 87 + 65 + 13 = 165 + 13 = 178 (not 35)
- 65 - 87 + 13 = -22 + 13 = -9 (not 35)
- 65 + 87 - 13 = 152 - 13 = 139 (not 35)
The combination 87 - 65 + 13 correctly gives us 35.

<think> First, we need to create an equation using the numbers 91, 70, and 95 that equals 74. We can try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Let's try combining the numbers directly: 95 - 91 + 70 = 74. This gives us our target result.
- We can verify the equation: 95 - 91 + 70 = 4 + 70 = 74.
This combination satisfies the condition of using each number exactly once and resulting in 74.

<answer> 95 - 91 + 70 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 85, 96, and 81. We need to create an equation using these numbers only once each to get the result of 92.
We can try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
- 96 - 85 = 11
- 11 + 81 = 92 (This is close but we haven't used 85 and 96 effectively yet)
- 96 + 81 - 85 = 92 (This looks promising as it uses all numbers and gives us 92)
96 + 81 - 85 = 92
</think>
<answer> 96 + 81 - 85 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 85, 96, and 81. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 92.
- Let's start by checking if any combination of basic operations can give us 92.
- 96 - 85 = 11 (This is close but not the answer.)
- 96 + 85 = 181 (This is too high.)
- 85 + 96 = 181 (Again, too high.)
- 96 + 81 - 85 = 92 (This looks promising. Let's verify: 96 + 81 equals 177, and subtracting 85 from 177 gives 92.)
- 85 + 81 + 96 = 262 (This is way too high.)
Therefore, the equation that works is 96 + 81 - 85 = 92.

We can start by looking at the numbers and trying to combine them in different ways:
- 52 - 29 - 25 = 2 (too low)
- 52 - 29 + 25 = 48 (this looks promising)
We have used all the numbers and arrived at the result of 48. Therefore, the equation is correct.

<answer> 52 - 29 + 25 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 52, 29, and 25. We need to create an equation that equals 48 using each number exactly once.
We can try combining the numbers using different operations:
- 52 - 29 - 25 = 7 (not 48)
- 52 - 29 + 25 = 52 + 25 - 29 = 77 - 29 = 48
This gives us a potential solution: 52 - 29 + 25 = 48

<answer> 52 - 29 + 25 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 81, 24, and 94. We need to create an equation that equals 37 using each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try different combinations:
- 94 - 81 - 24 = 94 - 81 - 24 = 3 - 24 = -21
- 94 - 81 + 24 = 94 - 81 + 24 = 13 + 24 = 37
- 94 + 81 - 24 = 94 + 81 - 24 = 175 - 24 = 151
- 81 + 24 - 94 = 81 + 24 - 94 = 105 - 94 = 11
The combination 94 - 81 + 24 equals 37.
</think>
<answer> 94 - 81 + 24 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's evaluate the possibilities by combining the numbers using basic arithmetic operations. We have the numbers 20, 1, 98, and 13. We need an equation that equals 92.
- Adding or subtracting the numbers doesn't seem promising as it would result in numbers far from 92.
- Let's try a combination like (98 - 20) + 13 + 1:
  98 - 20 = 78
  78 + 13 = 91
  91 + 1 = 92
This combination seems to work. Let's verify if there's a different order, but given that we only have one of each number and the operation order already gives us the correct result, this is likely the correct combination.
</think>
<answer> (98 - 20) + 13 + 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 75, 10, 84, and 70. We need to create an equation that equals 79 using each number exactly once.
Let's try different combinations:
- 75 - 10 - 84 + 70 = 51 (not 79)
- 75 - 10 + 84 + 70 = 219 (too high)
- 75 + 10 - 84 + 70 = 71 (not 79)
- 75 + 10 + 84 + 70 = 240 (too high)
- 75 + 84 - 10 + 70 = 219 (too high)
- Let's try a different grouping: 84 - 75 + 10 + 70 = 89 (too high)
- Now let's try: 84 - 75 - 10 + 70 = 69 (not 79)
- Finally, let's try: 84 + 10 - 75 + 70 = 89 (too high)
It seems none of these work by simple addition and subtraction. Now, let's try multiplication and division:
- 75 * 10 / 84 + 70  = 89.027... (too high)
- 75 / 10 + 84 + 70 = 169 (too high)
- 70 * 10 / 84 + 75 = 108.333... (too high)
The correct combination we need:
- 84 - 75 + 10 + 70 = 89
- Simplifying the key combination 75 - 10 + 84 - 70 = 79

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 50, 7, and 41. We need to create an equation that equals 16 using each number only once and with basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try different combinations:
- 50 - 7 - 41 = 3, which is not 16.
- 50 - 7 + 41 = 84, which is not 16.
- 50 + 7 - 41 = 16, which could be right.
So, 50 + 7 - 41 does indeed equal 16.

<answer> 50 + 7 - 41 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 76, 37, 93, and 67. We need to create an equation that equals 65 using each number exactly once.
Let's start combining them:
- 76 - 37 - 93 + 67 doesn't work because it equals -42.
- 76 + 37 - 93 - 67 also doesn't work because it equals -47.
- 76 - 37 + 93 - 67 doesn't work because it equals 65.
- 76 + 37 - 93 + 67 doesn't work because it equals 87.
- 76 - (37 - 93 + 67) doesn't simplify to 65.
- Checking permutations, one statement proving 67 - 37 + 93 - 76 does not work out as - (93-76 + 37 ) does not give 65.
The only viable option left is: 76 - 37 + 93 - 67 = 65.

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 73, 37, and 5. We need to create an equation that equals 41 using each number only once and basic arithmetic operations.
One way to approach this is to try different combinations of operations.
Let's try: 73 - 37 + 5
73 - 37 = 36
36 + 5 = 41
This gives us our desired result of 41. Therefore, the equation is 73 - 37 + 5.

Let's verify: 46 + 23 + 16 indeed equals 85.
</think>
<answer> 46 + 23 + 16 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider all possible combinations of the numbers 16, 23, and 46 using the basic arithmetic operations. We need to get 85 as the result.
1. 46 + 23 + 16 = 85
2. 46 + 23 - 16 = 53
3. 46 + 16 - 23 = 39
4. 46 - 23 + 16 = 39
5. 23 + 16 + 46 = 85
6. 23 + 16 - 46 = -7
7. 23 - 46 + 16 = -13
8. 16 + 23 + 46 = 85
9. 16 + 23 - 46 = -9
10. 16 - 46 + 23 = -9
11. 16 - 23 + 46 = 39
From the above combinations, we can see that 46 + 23 + 16 = 85 and 16 + 23 + 46 = 85 are the valid equations. Since we are instructed to use each number only once, either solution would be acceptable.
</think>
<answer> 46 + 23 + 16 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to create an equation that equals 42 using the numbers 84, 23, 28, and 93 exactly once. Let's try different combinations:
- 84 - 23 - 28 - 93 is -62 (too low)
- 84 - 23 - 28 + 93 is 126 (too high)
- 84 - 23 + 28 - 93 is 16 (too low)
- 84 + 23 - 28 - 93 is 8 (too low)
- 84 + 23 + 28 - 93 is 42 (this could be our answer)
So, the equation 84 + 23 + 28 - 93 equals 42.
</think>
<answer> 84 + 23 + 28 - 93 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 94, 52, 57, and 42. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once that equals 57.
- Let's try combining 94 - 52 = 42, and then see what we can do with the remaining numbers 57 and 42.
- Now we have 42 + 57 = 99, which isn't 57.
- Let's try another combination: 94 - 57 + 52 - 42. This doesn't seem promising as well.
- Let's try 57 - (52 - 42) + 94. This simplifies to 57 - 10 + 94 = 41 + 94 = 135, which is also not 57.
- The combination 57 + (94 - 52 - 42) works because 57 + (94 - 52 - 42) = 57 + (42 - 42) = 57 + 0 = 57.
So the equation that works is 57 + (94 - 52 - 42) or more simply as 57 + (94 - 52 - 42) = 57.

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 94, 52, 57, and 42. We need to create an equation that equals 57 using each number only once.
We can try different combinations of operations:
94 - 52 - 57 + 42 = 14 + 42 - 57 = 56 - 57 = -1 (Not equal to 57)
94 - 52 + 42 - 57 = 42 + 42 - 57 = 84 - 57 = 27 (Not equal to 57)
94 + 52 - 57 + 42 = 146 - 57 = 89 (Not equal to 57)
57 is one of the numbers, let's try replacing:
57 + 94 - 52 + 42 = 151 - 52 = 99 (Not equal to 57)
57 + 94 + 42 - 52 = 151 + 11 = 162 (Not equal to 57)
Instead, maybe simply adding the other numbers gives:
57 + 94 + 42 - 52 = 151 - 52 = 99 (Not right now)
Now, let's assume:
57 + 94 - 52 + 42 - 94 = 57 (This needs possibly position review)
Another evaluate:
We count the actual simplification, realizing summing specific numbers immediately efficiently:
57 + (94 -52 + 42) = 57 + 84 = 141 (Not 57)
After rechecking clear then right value:

Let's try different combinations:
- 28 + 81 + 96 + 24 = 239 (which is too high)
- 96 + 24 + 81 - 28 = 173 (which is also too high)
- 81 - 96 + 28 + 24 = 37 (this looks promising)
So, the equation 81 - 96 + 28 + 24 = 37 holds true.

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 10, 39, and 87. We need to create an equation that equals 58 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
- Let's try different combinations:
  - 87 - 39 - 10 = 48 (not 58)
  - 87 - 39 + 10 = 68 (not 58)
  - 87 + 39 - 10 = 116 (not 58)
  - 10 + 39 + 87 = 136 (not 58)
  - 87 + 39 + 10 = 136 (not 58)
  - 39 + 87 + 10 = 136 (not 58)
  - Trying multiplication and division didn't yield the right result either.
So, none of the simple combinations work. Let's try rearranging the operations:
  - (87 - 39) + 10 = 48 (not 58)
  - (87 + 39) - 10 = 116 (not 58)
  - (39 + 10) + 87 = 136 (not 58)
It seems my attempts over the basic operations are not yielding 58. This might be a trick question to force us to use other operations, but given these operations and the numbers available, none produce 58.
However rechecking calculations and the constraints reveals: Operations like subtraction and addition or multiplication and division do not easily form 58. Hence a need to take into opportunity for minor calculation misinterpretation on basic operation;
(39 - 10) + 87 = 39 - 10 = 29 and add 87 gives 116: makes a harder problem.
Alternative using primarily:
 87 + (10 - 39) => 87 + (-29) : calculation missteps on parenthesis use shown as logical simplification pressure on student smarter basic arithmetic demonstrated. 
Therefore takes a seeing misinterpretationordinated basics drawing initially see this was hinted this. </think>

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 72, 75, and 38. We need to create an equation that equals 41 using each number exactly once.
Let's try different combinations:

- 75 - 38 = 37, not 41
- 72 - 38 = 34, not 41
- 75 + 38 = 113, not 41
- 72 + 38 = 110, not 41
- 75 + 72 = 147, not 41
Now let's try multiplication and division:
- 75 * 38 / 72, this results in a non-integer value.
- 72 * 38 / 75, this also results in a non-integer value.
- 38 * 72 / 75, this simplifies to 2976 / 75 ≈ 39. 68, not 41
- 38 * 75 / 72 = 2850 / 72 ≈ 39. 58, not 41
We can't combine these operations into the 41.
Given that none of these combinations work, we might consider forming equation in reverse logic, rechecking:
- 75 + 38 - 72 = 41, clearly works.

<think> First, let's evaluate the given numbers: 16, 89, and 37. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get 68.
We can try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
16 + 89 + 37 = 142 (not 68)
16 + 89 - 37 = 68 (this equals 68, which is what we want)
So, the equation 16 + 89 - 37 equals 68.

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 16, 89, and 37. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get a result of 68.
Let's try different combinations:
- 89 - 37 - 16 = 36 (not 68)
- 89 - 37 + 16 = 68 (this could be the solution)
We found that 89 - 37 + 16 equals 68.

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 33, 17, and 5. We need to create an equation that equals 11 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try different combinations:
- 33 - 17 - 5 = 11 (This works because 33 minus 17 equals 16, and then 16 minus 5 equals 11)
So, the equation that uses all numbers exactly once and results in 11 is 33 - 17 - 5.
</think>
<answer> 33 - 17 - 5 </answer>

<think> First, we need to use the numbers 81, 29, and 81 to create an equation that equals 29. We can try different combinations of the operations and numbers.
Let's try: 81 - 81 + 29
81 - 81 = 0
0 + 29 = 29
This gives us the result we want. Therefore, the equation is 81 - 81 + 29 = 29.

We can try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
- 66 + 6 - 25 = 47 (This combination gives us the right result)
So, the equation that equals 47 using the numbers 6, 25, and 66 exactly once is 66 + 6 - 25.
</think>
<answer> 66 + 6 - 25 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 6, 25, and 66. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 47.
We can try different combinations of operations:
- 66 - 25 - 6 = 35 (This is too high)
- 66 - 25 + 6 = 47 (This looks promising)
Let's verify if 66 - 25 + 6 equals 47.
(66 - 25) + 6 = 41 + 6 = 47
This is correct. Therefore, the equation is 66 - 25 + 6 = 47.

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 20, 60, and 52. We need to create an equation that equals 92 using each number exactly once.
We can try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
- 60 + 20 + 52 = 132 (This is too high)
- 60 + 20 - 52 = 28 (This is too low)
- 60 + 52 - 20 = 92 (This looks promising)
- 60 - 20 + 52 = 92 (This is the same as the previous, and correct)
We have two possibilities that both work: 60 + 52 - 20 and 60 - 20 + 52. Since the question doesn't specify a unique solution, either one is acceptable.
</think>
<answer> 60 + 52 - 20 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 20, 60, and 52. We need to create an equation using each number exactly once to get the result of 92.
Let's try different combinations:
- 60 + 20 + 52 = 132 (not 92)
- 60 + 20 - 52 = 28 (not 92)
- 60 + 52 - 20 = 92 (this equals 92)
So, the equation 60 + 52 - 20 equals 92.

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 9, 58, and 12. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 55.
- Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- If we add 9 and 12, we get 21. Then we need 34 more to reach 55, but there's no other number left to get 34.
- If we add 9 and 58, we get 67, which is too high.
- If we subtract 9 from 58, we get 49. Then we need 6 more to reach 55, and 12 is the only number left which gives us 12 + 49 = 61, which is also too high.
- If we subtract 12 from 58, we get 46. Then we need 9 more to reach 55, and 9 is the other number left which gives us 46 + 9 = 55.
So the equation that works is 58 - 12 + 9.

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 61, 24, and 57. We need to create an equation that equals 20 using each number only once and with basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try different combinations:
- 61 - 24 - 57 = -40 (not 20)
- 61 - 24 + 57 = 94 (not 20)
- 61 + 24 - 57 = 28 (not 20)
- 61 + 57 - 24 = 94 - 24 = 70 (not 20)
- 57 + 24 - 61 = 81 - 61 = 20 (this works)
So, we found that 57 + 24 - 61 equals 20.

Let's try different combinations:
- 96 - 85 - 70 + 73 = 14
  96 - 85 = 11
  11 - 70 = -59
  -59 + 73 = 14
This combination works because 96 - 85 - 70 + 73 indeed equals 14.
</think>
<answer> 96 - 85 - 70 + 73 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 45, 7, and 5. We need to create an equation that equals 47 using each number exactly once with the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
We can start trying combinations:
- 45 + 7 + 5 = 57 (This is too high)
- 45 + 7 - 5 = 47 (This could be right)
- 45 + 5 - 7 = 43 (This is too low)
- 45 - 7 + 5 = 43 (This is too low)
- 7 + 45 - 5 = 47 (This works)
So, we have two potential solutions: 45 + 7 - 5 and 7 + 45 - 5. Both are valid, but the order of numbers is different. </think>
<answer> 45 + 7 - 5 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 45, 7, and 5. We need to create an equation that equals 47 using each number exactly once.
We can try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
- 45 + 7 + 5 = 57 (which is too high)
- 45 + 7 - 5 = 47 (this looks promising)
- 45 + 5 - 7 = 43 (which is too low)
- 45 - 7 + 5 = 43 (which is too low)
- 45 * 7 / 5 = 63 (which is too high)
- 45 / 7 + 5 = 8.857 (which is not an integer and thus not a valid solution)
From the above calculations, it's clear that 45 + 7 - 5 equals 47.
</think>
<answer> 45 + 7 - 5 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 45, 7, and 5. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 47.
We can start by adding or subtracting these numbers and then use the result to reach 47.
If we add 45 and 5, we get 50. Then, subtracting 7 from 50 gives us 43, which is not 47.
Next, let's try another combination: if we subtract 5 from 45, we get 40. Then adding 7 to 40 gives us 47.
So, the equation is 45 - 5 + 7 = 47.

Let's try different combinations:
- 34 + 16 + 45 = 95 (This works! )
- Other combinations like 34 + 45 - 16, 16 + 45 + 34, etc., do not equal 95.
So, the correct equation is 34 + 16 + 45.

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 21, 18, 94, and 7. We need to create an equation that equals 98 using each number exactly once.
Let's try different combinations of operations:
- 94 - 21 - 18 + 7 = 76 (not 98)
- 94 - 21 + 18 - 7 = 84 (not 98)
- 94 + 21 - 18 - 7 = 90 (not 98)
- 94 + 21 + 18 - 7 = 126 (not 98)
- 94 + 21 - 18 + 7 = 104 (not 98)
- 94 - 21 + 18 + 7 = 98 (this works)
So, the equation is 94 - 21 + 18 + 7 = 98.

<answer> 94 - 21 + 18 + 7 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's evaluate the given numbers: 37, 90, 21, and 43. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to equal 75.
We can start by looking at the possible combinations:
- 37 + 90 + 21 + 43 = 191 (which is too large)
- 90 + 43 - 37 - 21 = 75 (which fits our requirement)
So, the equation 90 + 43 - 37 - 21 equals 75.
</think>
<answer> 90 + 43 - 37 - 21 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 37, 90, 21, and 43. We need to create an equation that equals 75 using each number exactly once.
Let's try different combinations:
- 90 - 37 - 21 - 43 = 90 - 91 = -1 (not 75)
- 90 - 37 + 21 - 43 = 90 - 60 = 30 (not 75)
- 90 - 37 + 43 - 21 = 90 - 37 + 43 - 21 = 53 + 43 - 21 = 96 - 21 = 75
This combination works because 90 - 37 + 43 - 21 equals 75.
</think>
<answer> 90 - 37 + 43 - 21 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 82, 80, and 29. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 58.
Let's try different combinations:
- 82 - 80 = 2, which is not 58
- 82 - 29 = 53, which is not 58
- 80 - 29 = 51, which is not 58
- 82 + 80 = 162, which is not 58
- 80 + 29 = 109, which is not 58
Now let's try other combinations:
- 80 + (82 - 29) = 80 + 53 = 133, which is not 58
- 29 + (82 - 80) = 29 + 2 = 31, which is not 58
It seems none of these straightforward combinations work. Now let's try:
- 80 + 29 - 82 = 89 - 82 = 7, which is not 58
- 29 + 80 - 82 = 109 - 82 = 27, which is not 58
No success so far. Let's involve division:
- (82 - 80) * 29 = 2 * 29 = 58! 
This works because (82 - 80) is 2, and 2 * 29 gives 58.
</think>
<answer> (82 - 80) * 29 </answer>

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 2, 79, and 39. We need to use each number exactly once to get the result of 42.
We can try different combinations of operations:
- Adding and subtracting: 2 + 79 - 39 = 42 (This works! )
- Multiplying and adding/subtracting: None of the simple combinations seem to work.
- Other operations: No other simple combinations of +, -, * will work using these numbers.
So, the equation that uses 2, 79, and 39 exactly once to get 42 is 2 + 79 - 39.

- 61 - 22 + 85 = 124 (not 46)
- 61 + 22 - 85 = 8 (not 46)
- 61 + 85 - 22 = 124 (not 46)
- 85 - 61 + 22 = 46 (this could work)
- 85 + 61 - 22 = 124 (not 46)
The combination 85 - 61 + 22 equals 46.

<answer> 85 - 61 + 22 </answer>

The equation (31 + 24 + 43) satisfies the requirement.

- 56 + 37 - 42 = 93 - 42 = 51 (this could work)
- 42 + 37 - 56 = 79 - 56 = 23 (not 51)
- 56 - 42 + 37 = 14 + 37 = 51 (this also works)
So, we have two potential solutions: 56 + 37 - 42 and 56 - 42 + 37.
Since the problem specifies to use each number only once, both solutions are valid. However, typically such problems seek a single solution, and here both combinations work. For the sake of providing one answer, let's choose 56 + 37 - 42.

86 - 44 + 56 - 82 = 66 (not 16)
86 + 44 - 56 + 82 = 156 (not 16)
86 + 44 - 56 - 82 = -4 (not 16)
86 + 56 - 44 - 82 = 16 (this works)
So, the equation 86 + 56 - 44 - 82 equals 16.

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 45, 86, and 92. We need to create an equation that equals 51 using each number exactly once with the allowed operations.
- Adding or subtracting these numbers in different combinations won't easily reach 51.
- Let's try multiplying some numbers and then subtracting/adding others.
Try: 92 - 86 + 45
This simplifies to: 16 + 45 = 61 (not 51)
Try: 92 + 86 - 45
This simplifies to: 178 - 45 = 133 (not 51)
Try: 86 + 45 - 92
This simplifies to: 131 - 92 = 39 (not 51)
We haven't found the combination yet. Let's try a different approach:
Try: 92 + (45 - 86)
This simplifies to: 92 + (-41) = 51
This gives us the desired result 51.

- Let's try different combinations:
- 84 + 91 - 17 - 57 = 101 - 74 = 27 (This is too low)
- 91 + 57 - 84 - 17 = 148 - 101 = 47 (This is too low)
- 91 + 17 - 84 - 57 = 108 - 141 = -33 (This is negative)
- 84 + 57 - 91 - 17 = 141 - 108 = 33 (This is too low)
- 91 - 84 + 17 + 57 = 7 + 17 + 57 = 24 + 17 = 41 (This is too low)
- Now, let's try 84 - 91 + 17 + 57
- 84 - 91 + 17 + 57 = -7 + 17 + 57 = 10 + 57 = 67
This combination works.

One way to approach this is to try different combinations of operations.
Let's try: 62 - 32 - 49
62 - 32 = 30
30 - 49 = -19 (This is close but not 19)
Now let's try: 62 - (32 + 49)
62 - 81 = -19 (This is not 19 either)
Let's try: (62 - 32) + 49
62 - 32 = 30
30 + 49 = 79 (This is not 19)
Finally, let's try: 49 + 32 - 62
49 + 32 = 81
81 - 62 = 19
This gives us the correct result of 19.

- 42 - 40 + 27 ≠ 11
- 42 - 27 + 40 ≠ 11
- 42 + 40 - 27 ≠ 11
- 42 + 27 - 40 = 29 (not 11)
- 40 - 42 + 27 + 40 = 85 (too large)
We might have overlooked something simple. Let's try another approach:
- 42 + 40 - 27 - 40 = 37 - 40 = -3 (not 11)
Now, let's look at:
- 40 + 27 - 42 - 40 = -15 (too negative)
Finally, looking at the options again:
40 + 27 - 42 = 37 - 42 = -5 (still negative)
After trying many combinations, we should look for add/subtract in the other sequence:
In fact, try the further:
40 + 27 = 67
42 - 67 = -25 (too negative)
The sequential logically clean:
- 27 + 40 = 67
- 67 -42 = 25
None match until:

96 + 92 / 2 = 194 (too high)
96 + 2 * 92 = 284 (too high)
96 / 2 + 92 = 140 (too low)
92 / 2 + 96 = 148 (too low)
92 * 2 + 96 = 284 (too high)
96 * 2 + 92 = 284 (too high)
92 * 2 / 96 = 0. 4 (way too low)
It seems we need to use different operations:
96 * 2 - 92 = 100
This finally works.  </think>

<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 57, 74, and 78 that equals 61, with each number used only once. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- 78 - 74 = 4 (not 61)
- 78 - 57 = 21 (not 61)
- 78 - 57 - 74 = -53 (not 61)
- 78 - 57 + 74 = 95 (not 61)
- 78 + 57 = 135 (not 61)
- 78 + 57 - 74 = 61 (this works)
So, the equation that uses all numbers once and equals 61 is 78 + 57 - 74 = 61.
</think>
<answer> 78 + 57 - 74 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 57, 74, and 78. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result 61.
One way to approach this is to try different combinations of operations.
(78 - 74) + 57 = 4 + 57 = 61
This combination gives us the correct result of 61 using each number exactly once.
</think>
<answer> (78 - 74) + 57 </answer>

<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 20, 8, and 54 exactly once to get 66. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- 54 + 20 + 8 = 82 (This is too high)
- 54 + 20 - 8 = 66 (This is exactly what we need)
So, the equation 54 + 20 - 8 equals 66.
</think>
<answer> 54 + 20 - 8 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 4, 30, and 64. We need to create an equation using these numbers only once each to equal 98.
We can start by adding and subtracting the smaller numbers and see if we can get close to 98.
4 + 30 = 34
34 + 64 = 98
This gives us the equation 34 + 64 = 98, but we've used 4 + 30 to get 34, and we can only use each number once.
Let's try a different combination:
(64 - 30) + 4 = 34 + 4 = 38
That's still not 98. Let's try another step:
30 + (64 - 4) = 30 + 60 = 90
That's closer, but not exactly 98. Let's try this one more time:
4 + (30 + 64) = 4 + 94 = 98
This works because we are using each number exactly once and we get the result of 98.
</think>
<answer> 4 + (30 + 64) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 4, 30, and 64 that equals 98, with each number used only once. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- 64 + 30 + 4 = 98 (This is correct as it uses all numbers once and gives the desired result. )
- Checking other combinations:
  - 64 + 30 - 4 = 90 (Not 98)
  - 64 + 4 - 30 = 38 (Not 98)
  - 64 - 30 + 4 = 38 (Not 98)
  - 64 - 4 + 30 = 90 (Not 98)
Thus, the correct equation is 64 + 30 + 4.

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 4, 30, and 64. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 98.
One way to approach this is to try different combinations of operations.
Let's try: 64 - 30 + 4
64 - 30 = 34
34 + 4 = 38
This doesn't work. Let's try another combination:
Let's try: 30 + 64 - 4
30 + 64 = 94
94 - 4 = 90
This is close but not 98. Let's try:
Let's try: 64 + 30 - 4
64 + 30 = 94
94 - 4 = 90
None of these seem to work. Let's rethink the combination:
Let's try: 64 + (30 - 4)
30 - 4 = 26
64 + 26 = 90
Still not 98. Let me try another:
Let's try: (64 + 30) - 4
64 + 30 = 94
94 - 4 = 90
None of these combinations work. Let me try a different approach:
Let's try: 64 + 30 + 4
64 + 30 = 94
94 + 4 = 98
This is the combination that works. Therefore, the equation is 64 + 30 + 4 = 98.

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 47, 21, and 1. We need to create an equation that equals 27 using each number exactly once.
- Let's try combining the numbers: 47 - 21 - 1 = 25. This is close but not 27.
- Let's try another combination: 47 - 21 + 1 = 27. This equals 27 exactly.
So, the equation 47 - 21 + 1 equals 27.
</think>
<answer> 47 - 21 + 1 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 18, 1, 38, and 75 exactly once to get 56. Let's try different combinations:
- 18 + 1 + 38 + 75 = 122 (too high)
- 38 + 18 + 1 + 75 = 122 (too high)
- 75 + 18 + 1 + 38 = 132 (too high)
- 1 + 18 + 38 + 75 = 132 (too high)
- 18 + 38 + 1 + 75 = 132 (too high)
- 1 + 38 + 18 + 75 = 132 (too high)
- 1 + 18 + 75 + 38 = 132 (too high)
- 38 + 1 + 18 + 75 = 122 (too high)
Now, let's try a different approach:
- 75 - 38 + 18 + 1 = 56 (This works)
So, the equation is 75 - 38 + 18 + 1 = 56.

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 57, 15, and 49. We need to create an equation that equals 23 using each number only once and basic arithmetic operations.
We can try different combinations:
- 57 - 15 - 49 = 13 (not 23)
- 57 - 15 + 49 = 91 (not 23)
- 57 + 15 - 49 = 23 (this could be it)
So, the equation 57 + 15 - 49 equals 23.

<answer> 57 + 15 - 49 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 16, 30, and 74. We need to create an equation that equals 60 using each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try different combinations:
- 16 + 30 + 74 = 120 (too large)
- 74 + 30 - 16 = 88 (too large)
- 74 + 16 - 30 = 60 (this could be right)
- 74 - 30 + 16 = 60 (this could be right)
- 30 + 74 - 16 = 88 (too large)
So, two potential equations are 74 + 16 - 30 = 60 and 30 + 74 - 16 = 60. However, the problem specifies using each number exactly once, and both 74 + 16 - 30 and 30 + 74 - 16 are essentially the same equation with the numbers just in a different order.
Thus, the correct and final equation is 74 + 16 - 30 = 60.

- 68 + 36 - 7 = 97 (This looks promising)
So, the equation 68 + 36 - 7 equals 97.

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 3, 16, and 8. We need to create an equation that equals 72 using each number exactly once and basic arithmetic operations.
- Let's try different combinations:
  - 16 * 8 / 3 = 128 / 3 (which doesn't equal 72)
  - 16 * 3 + 8 = 48 + 8 = 56 (which doesn't equal 72)
  - 16 * 3 - 8 = 48 - 8 = 40 (which doesn't equal 72)
  - 16 + 8 * 3 = 16 + 24 = 40 (which doesn't equal 72)
  - 8 * 3 + 16 = 24 + 16 = 40 (which doesn't equal 72)
  - 8 + 16 * 3 = 8 + 48 = 56 (which doesn't equal 72)
  - 3 * 16 + 8 = 48 + 8 = 56 (which doesn't equal 72)
  - 3 + 16 * 8 = 3 + 128 = 131 (which doesn't equal 72)
  - 16 + 3 * 8 = 16 + 24 = 40 (which doesn't equal 72)
  - 8 + 3 * 16 = 8 + 48 = 56 (which doesn't equal 72)
  - 8 * (16 - 3) = 8 * 13 = 104 (which doesn't equal 72)
  - 16 * (8 - 3) = 16 * 5 = 80 (which doesn't equal 72)
  - (8 - 3) * 16 = 5 * 16 = 80 (which doesn't equal 72)
  - (16 - 3) * 8 = 13 * 8 = 104 (which doesn't equal 72)
  - 3 * (16 + 8) = 3 * 24 = 72 (which equals 72)

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 17, 13, and 18. We need to form an equation that equals 85 using each number exactly once.
Let's try different combinations:
1. 17 + 13 + 18 = 48 (which is not 85)
2. 17 + 18 + 13 = 48 (which is not 85)
3. 18 + 17 + 13 = 48 (which is not 85)
4. 18 + 13 + 17 = 48 (which is not 85)
Now, let's try multiplication or combination with subtraction:
1. 18 * (17 - 13) = 18 * 4 = 72 (which is not 85)
2. 17 * (18 - 13) = 17 * 5 = 85 (which is the correct result)
So, the equation that works is 17 * (18 - 13) = 85.

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 99, 87, 70, and 19. We need to create an equation using each number exactly once to equal 97.
One way to approach this is to try different combinations of operations.
Let's try: 99 - 87 + 70 - 19
99 - 87 = 12
12 + 70 = 82
82 - 19 = 63
This doesn't give us 97. Let's try another combination.
Let's try: 99 - 87 + 19 + 70
99 - 87 = 12
12 + 19 = 31
31 + 70 = 101
This also doesn't give us 97. Let's try: 99 + 87 - 70 - 19
99 + 87 = 186
186 - 70 = 116
116 - 19 = 97
This combination works. 99 + 87 - 70 - 19 equals 97.

<think> First, let's consider the numbers 99, 87, 70, and 19. We need to create an equation that equals 97 using each number exactly once.
We can try different combinations of operations:
(99 - 87) + 70 + 19 = 12 + 70 + 19 = 181 (too high)
99 + 87 - 70 - 19 = 186 - 70 - 19 = 116 (too high)
99 - (87 - 70) - 19 = 99 - 7 - 19 = 73 (too low)
Let's try another combination:
99 + 87 - 70 - 19 = 186 - 70 - 19 = 97
This combination works because it uses each number exactly once and equals 97.

- 90 - 78 + 40 = 52
- 90 + 78 - 40 = 128
- 90 + 40 - 78 = 52
- 78 - 90 + 40 = 28 (This looks promising)
So, the equation 78 - 90 + 40 equals 28.

<answer> 78 - 90 + 40 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers 90, 78, and 40. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 28.
- Let's try combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- One way to approach this is to look at smaller parts and see if they can be combined:
  - 90 - 78 = 12
  - Now we need 16 more to make 28 (since 12 + 16 = 28)
  - 90 - (78 - 40) = 90 - 38 = 52 (doesn't work)
  - Let's try another combination:
  - 90 - (78 + 40) = 90 - 118 = -28 (doesn't work)
  - Instead, let's try 78 - 40 + 90: 
  - 78 - 40 = 38
  - 38 + 90 = 128 (doesn't work)
  - Lastly, let's try using multiplication or division:
  - 90 / 40 + 78 = 2.25 + 78 = 80.25 (doesn't work)
  - We recognize we need a different approach using addition and subtraction:
  - 90 - 78 + 40 - 90 = -28 (considers incorrect all round still)
- Final effective trial of 78 - 90 + 40 = 28 indeed checks.

- 72 + 54 + 60 = 186 (not 42)

- 15 + 2 * 1 = 15 + 2 = 17 (not 28)
- 2 * 15 + 1 = 30 + 1 = 31 (not 28)
- 2 * (15 - 1) = 2 * 14 = 28 (This is 28! )

- 78 - 56 + 43 + 17 = 82 (too high)
- 78 + 56 + 43 - 17 = 164 (too high)
Now let's try a different approach:
56 + 43 - 78 + 17 = 38
This combination works because:
56 + 43 = 99
99 - 78 = 21
21 + 17 = 38
So the correct equation is 56 + 43 - 78 + 17 = 38.

  84 + 32 - 46 = 68 (This is too low)
  84 + 46 - 32 = 98 (This looks promising)
  32 + 46 - 84 = 98 (This is also correct)
  46 + 32 - 84 = 18 (This is too low)
- We see that 84 + 46 - 32 = 98 and 32 + 46 - 84 = 98.
So, the equation that equals 98 is (84 + 46 - 32) or (32 + 46 - 84).

- Now, let's try 79 - 33 - 22 + 47 = 71 (Too low)
- Trying another combination: 79 - 33 + 47 - 22 = 71 (Too low)
Finally, let's try: 
79 - 47 + 33 + 22 = 87
Indeed, this combination works because:

- 79 + 22 + 47 - 33 = 135 (too high)
- 79 + 33 - 22 + 47 = 137 (too high)
After trying these combinations, we realize a direct solution may not be straightforward. However we can try 79 + 22 + 33 + 47 - 140 where 140 is an overestimate but realizing placeholders:

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 63, 43, and 39. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once to get the result of 59.
We can try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
- 63 - 43 - 39 = -19 (too low)
- 63 - 43 + 39 = 59 (this looks promising)
- 63 + 43 - 39 = 67 (too high)
- 63 + 43 + 39 = 145 (too high)
The combination 63 - 43 + 39 equals 59.

<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 60, 20, 88, and 75 exactly once to get 93. Let's try different combinations:
- 88 + 75 - 60 - 20 = 163 - 80 = 83 (not 93)
- 88 + 75 - 60 + 20 = 163 - 60 + 20 = 123 - 60 = 63 (not 93)
- 88 + 75 + 60 - 20 = 223 - 20 = 203 (too high)
- 88 + 75 - 20 + 60 = 163 + 40 = 203 (too high)
- 88 + 60 + 20 - 75 = 148 + 20 - 75 = 168 - 75 = 93 (this works)
So, the correct equation is 88 + 60 + 20 - 75 = 93.

<think> First, let's consider all possible combinations using the numbers 46, 7, 96, and 30 with basic arithmetic operations. We need to form an equation that equals 73.
(46 + 7) + 96 + 30 = 93 + 96 + 30 = 229 (too high)
46 + (7 + 96) + 30 = 109 + 30 = 139 (too high)
(46 + 96) + (7 + 30) = 142 + 37 = 179 (too high)
(46 + 7) + (96 + 30) = 53 + 126 = 179 (too high)
(96 - 7) + (46 + 30) = 89 + 76 = 165 (too high)
(96 + 46) - (7 + 30) = 142 - 37 = 105 (too high)
(7 + 30) + (46 - 96) = 37 - 50 = -13 (too low)
None of these combinations work. Let's try another approach:
96 + 30 + 7 - 46 = 126 - 46 = 80 (too high)
46 + 96 + 7 - 30 = 149 - 30 = 119 (too high)
46 + 30 + 7 - 96 = 83 - 96 = -13 (too low)
30 + 46 + 7 - 96 = 83 - 96 = -13 (too low)
Finally, let's try 96 + 7 - 46 + 30 = 103 - 46 = 57 (too low, try again)
96 - 46 + 30 + 7 = 50 + 30 + 7 = 87 (too high)
46 + 96 - 30 + 7 = 142 - 30 + 7 = 119 (too high)
96 + 30 - 7 - 46 = 126 - 7 - 46 = 73 (correct!)

Then, let's try 78 - 32:
78 - 32 = 46 (which is too low)
Now, let's try 55 + 32:
55 + 32 = 87 (which is too high)

55 + 45 = 100 (which is too high)
Finally, let's try 55 + 78 - 45 - 32 = 55 + 43 = 98 (which is still too high).
After numerous trials, notice:
55 + 45 - 78 - 32 also does not work.

- 98 - 75 + 27 = 50 (this looks promising)
- 98 - 27 - 75 = 41 (too high)
- 98 + 75 - 27 = 146 (too high)
- 75 - 98 + 27 = 4 (too low)
- 27 + 98 - 75 = 50 (this also works)
So, we have two potential solutions: 98 - 75 + 27 and 27 + 98 - 75. Both are mathematically correct, but we should return one of them.

75 + 27 = 102 (not 50)
Finally, let's try:
98 + 75 - 27 = 148 - 27 = 121 (not 50)
We missed an earlier possibility:
75 + (98 - 27) = 75 + 71 = 146 (not 50)
Then:
98 - (75 - 27) = 98 - 48 = 50
This satisfies the condition.

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 31, 23, and 64 that equals 72. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- 31 + 23 + 64 = 118 (not 72)
- 31 + 23 - 64 = 0 (not 72)

- 70 - 35 + 64 = 99 (not 32)
- 70 + 35 - 64 = 41 (not 32)
- 70 + 35 + 64 = 170 (not 32)
- 70 - (35 + 64) = 70 - 99 = -29 (not 32)
- 64 + 35 - 70 = 35 - 70 = -35 (not 32)
- 64 - 35 + 70 = 29 + 70 = 99 (not 32)
- 70 * (35 / 64) = 1825 / 64 ≈ 28.67 (not 32)
- 35 * (64 / 70) = 2240 / 70 ≈ 32.00 (this is very close and fits exactly)

- 88 + 70 = 158 (This is too high)
- 70 * 88 = 6160 (This is far too high)
- 70 / 88 is a fraction and not 88
We can also try combining operations and reordering the numbers:
- 88 - 70 + 70 = 88 (This works since 88 - 70 = 18 and then 18 + 70 = 88)

  = 45 - 46 - 90 + 91
  = -1 - 90 + 91
  = -91 + 91
  = 0
This is not correct.

- 62 - 60 + 33 = 33
- 62 + 60 - 33 = 92
- 62 + 60 + 33 = 155
None of these give us 31. Let's try another approach with different order of operations:
- 60 - 62 + 33 = 31
This combination works because:
60 - 62 = -2
-2 + 33 = 31
So the equation is 60 - 62 + 33 = 31.

It seems none of these simple combinations work. Let's try multiplication and division:
- 45 * 15 / 85 = 67.5 (Not 88)
- 85 * 15 / 45 = 29.1111... (Not 88)
We've exhausted the combinations of operations and didn't find the answer. However, let's check another order:

- Subtracting 32 from 75 gives us 43, and then adding 44 gives us 87, which is also too high.
- Subtracting 44 from 75 gives us 31, and then adding 72 and 32 gives us 105, which is too high.
- Subtracting 72 from 75 gives us 3, and then adding 44 and 32 gives us 78, which is close but not 79.
- Adding 75 and 44 gives us 119, which is too high.
- Adding 72 and 32 gives us 104, which is too high.

  67 + 60 - 12 = 115 (not 19)
  67 + 12 - 60 = 19 (this could be the solution)

<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 27, 95, and 49 exactly once to get the result of 19. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- 95 - 27 - 49 ≠ 19
- 95 - 27 + 49 ≠ 19
- 95 + 27 - 49 ≠ 19
- 27 + 95 - 49 ≠ 19
- 49 + 27 - 95 ≠ 19
- 49 - 27 + 95 = 123 ≠ 19
It seems none of these direct combinations work. Let's try another approach:
(95 - 49) - 27 = 46 - 27 = 19
This works because 95 - 49 = 46 and 46 - 27 = 19.

- 68 + 15 + 55 - 61 = 83 - 61 = 22 (too low)
- 68 + 55 + 61 - 15 = 123 + 46 = 169 (too high)
- 68 + 61 + 15 - 55 = 149 - 55 = 94 (too high)
- 68 - 55 + 15 + 61 = 13 + 76 = 89 (too high)
- 68 - 55 + 61 + 15 = 13 + 76 = 89 (too high)

<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 9, 70, and 30 that equals 49. We can try different combinations of the operations.
Let's try: 70 - 9 - 30
70 - 9 = 61
61 - 30 = 31 (This is not 49)
Let's try: 70 - 9 + 30
70 - 9 = 61
61 + 30 = 91 (This is not 49)
Let's try: 9 + 70 - 30
9 + 70 = 79
79 - 30 = 49 (This is correct)
So, the equation that equals 49 is 9 + 70 - 30.

- 49 + 64 - 42 + 32 = 103 (not 39)
- 49 - 64 + 42 + 32 = 59 (not 39)
- 32 + 42 + 49 - 64 = 59 (not 39)
None of these combinations work. Let's check another logical transformation:

This combination works.
</think>
<answer> 49 + (64 - 32) - 42 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 42, 49, 64, and 32 exactly once to get the result of 39. Let's try different combinations:
- 42 - 49 + 64 + 32 = 99 (not 39)
- 42 + 49 - 64 + 32 = 59 (not 39)
- 42 + 49 + 64 - 32 = 123 (not 39)
- 42 - 49 + 64 + 32 = 99 (already tried)
- 42 + 49 + 64 - 32 = 123 (already tried)
- 42 + 49 - 64 + 32 = 59 (already tried)
- Trying different orders: 49 + 64 - 42 - 32 = 39 (this works)
Thus, the correct equation is 49 + 64 - 42 - 32 = 39.

- 99 - 51 + 44 - 28 = 48 + 44 - 28 = 92 - 28 = 64 (not 32)
- 99 + 51 - 44 - 28 = 150 - 72 = 78 (not 32)
- 99 - 51 - (44 - 28) = 48 - 16 = 32 (this works)
So, the correct equation is 99 - 51 - (44 - 28) = 32.

- 99 - 62 + 65 - 62 = 40 (99 - 62 = 37, 37 + 65 = 102, 102 - 62 = 40) - This is not 90.
- 99 + 62 - 65 - 62 = 34 (99 + 62 = 161, 161 - 65 = 96, 96 - 62 = 34) - This is not 90.
- 99 + 62 - 65 + 62 = 198 - 65 = 133 (This is not 90).

- 23 * (40 - 6) = 23 * 34 = 782 (not 23)
- 23 + 40 + 6 = 71 (not 23)
None of the above combinations worked. Let me re-examine:
- (40 + 6) - 23 = 46 - 23 = 23 - Yes!
Therefore, the correct equation is (40 + 6) - 23.

- 4 + 97 + 56 ≠ 37
- 97 + 4 - 56 = 45
- 97 - 56 - 4 = 37 (This is also a valid equation)
So, we have two potential equations: 97 - 4 - 56 = 37 and 97 - 56 - 4 = 37. Since both are correct, we can present either one.

- 76 + 43 - 98 = 21 (not 65)
- 98 + 43 - 76 = 65 (this equals 65)
So, the equation 98 + 43 - 76 equals 65.</think>

- 75 + 30 - 36 = 75 + 6 = 81 (too high)
- 75 + 36 - 30 = 111 - 30 = 81 (too high)
- 75 - (36 - 30) = 75 - 6 = 69 (too low)
- (75 + 36) - 30 = 111 - 30 = 81 (too high)
- 36 + 75 - 30 = 111 - 30 = 81 (too high)
- 36 + (75 - 30) = 36 + 45 = 81 (too high)
- Let's check another possibility: (75 + 36 + 30) / 2 = 141 / 2 = 70.5 (not an integer)
- Checking the last combination: 75 * 36 / 30 = 2700 / 30 = 90
This combination works.

- 83 - 52 - 39 = -10 (not 70)
- 83 + 52 - 39 = 96 (not 70)
- 52 + 83 - 39 = 96 (not 70)
- 39 + 52 - 83 = 7 (not 70)
It seems the initial combinations didn't work. Let's try a different approach or check if we missed something:
- Another possible structuring could be using brackets differently:
  (83 - 52) + 39 = 31 + 39 = 70
This works!
So the correct equation that gives 70 is (83 - 52) + 39. </think>

- 90 - 1 + 57 = 146 (too high)
- 90 + 1 - 57 = 34 (too high)
- 90 + 1 + 57 = 148 (too high)
- 90 - (1 - 57) = 90 - (-56) = 146 (too high)
- (90 + 1) - 57 = 91 - 57 = 34 (too high)
- 90 / (1 + 57) = 90 / 58 (not an integer)
- Using multiplication or higher operations would complicate without achieving 33.
Clearly, using simple operations, the equation construction is not yielding 33. However, performing correct operations that others may conclude wouldn't be typical left. But recognizing a feasible standard operation issue, it follows establishing simple combinations as typical.
Proven logically, none operational exact forming typical 33 with all constraints, thus reconsider typical constraints none fitting exact valid standard value naturally.

- Finally, let's try 84 + 13 - 95 = 97 - 95 = 2 (not 24)
I missed an important combination. Calculating a little differently, 95 - (84 / 13) * 13 may be worth checking as 13/13 = 1 and then this simplifies the equation further: 95 - (84/13) can also be (95-6. 3846) then it equates to 88. 6154. This approach doesn't seem to help, hence checking simple operations suggests other ways.
Rechecking - how we scripted the operation again ensures uniqueness. 95 - (84/13) simplifies to 24 ⹡ 13 = 24. Simplifies confirming simpler operations likely missed.
Answer being a) a missed verification. Thus derived likely extreme factor if brute checking thorough solutions confirm.

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 42, 85, and 8 that equals 35. Let's try different combinations of the operations.
- First, let's check if we can combine them in a straightforward way:
  - 42 - 85 + 8 doesn't work because it's -41
  - 42 + 85 + 8 = 135
  - 85 - 42 + 8 = 51
  - 42 * 85 / 8 or 85 * 8 / 42 doesn't give a whole number that works.
  - Now let's try another approach:
  - 85 - 42 - 8 = 35
  This combination works as it follows the basic arithmetic: 85 minus 42 equals 43, then subtract 8 from 43 to get 35.

Finally, consider:
41 + 81 - 81 + 5 = 54 already too high.
We see 41 + 81 = 122 and then subtractings:
41 + 81 - 5 + 39 = 166 then check other removal

- 66 - 35 + 25 + 16 = 62 (too low)
- 66 - 35 - 25 + 16 = 22 (too low)
- 35 + 25 + 16 + 66 = 142 (too high)
- 25 + 35 + 16 + 66 = 142 (too high)

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 23, 36, and 27 exactly once to get the result 86. We can try different combinations of the operations.
Let's try: 36 - 23 + 27
1. 36 - 23 = 13
2. Then, 13 + 27 = 40
That doesn't work. Let's try another combination.
Now let's try: 36 + 27 - 23
1. 36 + 27 = 63
2. Then, 63 - 23 = 40
That also doesn't work. Let's try: 36 + 23 - 27
1. 36 + 23 = 59
2. Then, 59 - 27 = 32
Not working. Let's now try: 36 - (27 - 23)
1. 27 - 23 = 4
2. Then, 36 - 4 = 32
